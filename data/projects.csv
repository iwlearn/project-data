The work of LOICZ is well documented but to-date there has been little focus on<br />Examples of catalytic benefits include:<br />The project began when there were only about 40 models / sites available. The GEF project added 170 models/sites to this and the work has been continuing after the completion of the project adding more data sets and using the data collected by the project. Over 400 budget models now are available at LOICZ. An example of this can be seen in the peer-reviewed scientific publication6 that clearly demonstrates the increasing desire to understand the processes of eutrophication and acknowledges the support the work received from UNEP/GEF. For example, the publication estimates that the total nutrient load of run-off to the world’s coastlines from major rivers has increased three times since the 1970s.<br />Adoption by universities, and EU projects and world-wide research programmes of the tools and methodologies into curricula for fundamental and applied training of regional scholars and scientists.

Scientists in most global regions are adopting the approach in project design and development, and as research tools. Links to extended catchment information and data includes the human dimensions community to a growing extent.<br />National use of the tools developed in science and coastal management information assessments is leading to additional supportive research and monitoring projects, supported by national and regional funders. UNIDO has engaged with LOICZ in using the approach for a major project proposal for potential implementation in West Africa examining nutrient reduction planning, monitoring and remediation interventions.

All 10 were involved in network building, being resource people for training workshops and two were extended into postgraduate training (1 PhD and 1 MSc candidature).  A network of trained modeling advisors was set up in developing regions, with about 180 scientists trained and continuing in the network. Additional scientists are being trained through adoption of methodologies in University curricula (e.g., South Africa, Philippines, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, Black Sea area).

This of course is necessary in order to focus subsequent interventions on solving or controlling these issues. However, at the same time, prioritising means ranking problems, which in turn, explicit or implicit, means answering a number of value-laden questions. Examples of such questions are: Are substances causing cancer in humans worse than those giving rise to reproductive failures in birds? Is a large quantity of a chemical no longer produced a larger problem than a smaller amount of one with rising production and use? Is an easily replaceable but less damaging chemical a higher priority than one more damaging, where no realistic alternatives exist? Is a well-investigated compound with by and large known risks, worse than one on which we have little information?<br />In all these cases, the answers would also have to be quantified: e.g. How many cases of human cancer correspond to ten thousand non-hatched bird eggs or an extinct bird species?<br />These sorts of questions obviously do not have scientific answers. Therefore, it is understandable that many of the Regional Coordinators and Regional Team Members at the onset of the project were reluctant to prioritise. Yet, when it came to the regional and global priority setting meetings, agreement or near agreement was reached on all the regional and global priorities. How was this resolved?<br />The key to the solution was a relatively simple scoring system, where the figures 2, 1 and 0 on one axis were used to mean Regional, Local, and No concern, respectively. The other axis had the groups Sources, Environmental levels, Eco-toxicological effects and Human effects. Scoring was done on available information, but each of the four groups also had a column for data gaps, where “0” meant supportive data existed, “1” that supportive data is limited, and “2” that supportive data are lacking.<br />A key feature was that there was no total score for a chemical. This is a clever and practical way to get around the unsolvable problem of comparing non-commensurable units, and one that has gained acceptance from a wide range of experts as a way to arrive at a science-based tool for administrative decision-making. It is a lesson learned with applications in a variety of fields and situations.<br /><br /><br />Another conceptual problem encountered in the project is the identification of global priorities based on regions, which differ significantly with regard to data availability, expertise, legislative framework and administrative and financial resources. As important from an ecological and toxicological point of view, is that temperature, humidity and food web structure, as well as species diversity and seasonal migration patterns (among many other parameters), may have a strong effect on sensitivity of populations and ecosystems. Similarly, human populations may have different sensitivities dependent on food habits, nutritional levels, age structure and numerous socio-economic factors.<br />Here the project was less innovative, and merely excluded from consideration all possible differences in sensitivity of ecosystems and human populations. Further, the global priorities came as a result of a summary that was balanced but somewhat mechanical of the priorities identified at the regional level.<br /><br /><br />A very special, possibly unique problem facing this project with regard to dissemination of results and follow up, is that the international focus on persistent substances has moved from PTS to POP, following the signing of the Stockholm Convention. There are two conceptual differences between the RBA/PTS project and the Convention. The project is region-based, whereas the Convention is basically global, with a potential for regional additions. Furthermore, the group of PTS is larger and in principle open-ended, while the Convention covers a small number - currently twelve - of specified chemicals or groups. The current situation, strengthened by the financial mechanism associated with the Stockholm Convention that provides funding through the Global Environment Facility (GEF) for, e.g., development of national implementation plans for POP, is that few of the developing country experts that were enthusiastically involved in the RBA/PTS project, work in their home countries today with any other part of PTS than the POP.<br />Seen from the project’s perspective, there is thus a significant risk that only those parts of the RBA/PTS that are covered by the Stockholm Convention can feed into any continuing activity. Its sustainability is thus an open question. The risks with the relative limited volume of information and the reach of the dissemination mechanisms for project results must be seen in this light.<br /><br /><br />On the practical level, a key question for the project to resolve was how to collect and evaluate a huge amount of data. The attempted solution was the development of web-based questionnaires and a GIS-based system for storage and handling of data. These two strategic decisions, using the web and geographic information, are future-oriented and commendable. It’s “lessons learned” from the project that should be remembered for numerous future applications.<br />However, for practical use within the project, neither the questionnaires nor the database and data handling system came to much use. In total, some 15,000 entries were made to the database using the questionnaires, which is not a small number and, as discussed elsewhere, represents a special value as much of it is data that is not available in the open literature, but was dug out from other sources and to a large extent came from regions where data are scarce. The future value of these data would be in relation to trend analyses, which could be crucial both for scientific purposes and to assess if chemicals that have been banned or for which the use has been restricted are still released. Thus the future users would be scientists and national environment protection agencies.<br />However, in relation to the total amount of data available for PTS, 15,000 entries is a drop in the sea. Most Regional Coordinators and Teams found the questionnaires unsuitable, either because they were too time-consuming to fill out with all the information requested, or because the information given was insufficient to assess the quality of the information. Some even used both arguments simultaneously.<br />It is clear that there has to be a compromise between the amount of information that has to be filled out, given the time it takes; and the amount and type of information needed for assessing the validity and relevance of the data. (See discussion by the interim reviewer on sediment sieving information!)<br />Unfortunately, the questionnaires developed for the project did not succeed in finding that balance.<br /><br /><br />With regard to the data-handling system, this was not used beyond testing for the evaluations and priority-settings within the project. In fact, the system is not yet bug-free. The work done is not bad, but unless a continued application is found, it will be wasted. It should probably have been foreseen that development of a data collection system, questionnaires, an evaluation mechanism for a large volume of data, a database and a data-handling system, were unattainable within the relatively short duration of the project and with the meagre staff resources available. The lesson to be learned is simply that development of data handling systems are time and resource consuming and should generally not be done ac hoc for short term uses.<br />In some regions of the world the main problem was not the lack of data, overall, but the vast amount of them in relation to time and personnel resources available for their collection and evaluation. This was especially true for Europe and North America. In the latter region, the strategy chosen to solve this problem was to select a “representative sub-region” – in this case the Great Lakes - and to concentrate the efforts on data from there. Judging both from many critical comments and from a careful reading of the resulting report, the conclusion is that the strategy failed to give the originally intended coverage and wide base for assessment of regional priorities. The European region’s much more comprehensive approach to the data volume problem worked far better. This lesson learned within the project should not be forgotten.<br /><br /><br />As individuals and teams with different backgrounds carried out much of the work at the regional level, it is obvious that their different traditions and expectations would lead to appearance of centrifugal tendencies, causing regions to start marching in different directions. This illustrates the classic management dilemma of how to keep experts enthusiastic, but at the same time converge their efforts towards a common coherent product. At several points during the execution of the project, such situations arose. Those occasions were handled commendably: the project’s management, with clever flexibility and some well-balanced compromises, together with a firm hand when needed, brought disparate regional efforts back in line while maintaining the good spirits of the experts involved. This is an important lesson learned in the project but one that might be difficult to generalize.<br /><br /><br />Given the complexity of the project and the administrative set-up, involving in total some 800 persons and more than 60 meetings, as well as ambitious and time-pressed programming work, it would have been extraordinary if there had been no administrative problems at all. During the project execution there were some, involving especially the Sub-Sahara and Central America-Caribbean regions. The problems were, in all except a few cases, ultimately sorted out, and the lessons appear mostly to be case-specific rather than general.</p>",,"<p>The global and regional reports and the network of experts form a good basis for replication of the project. From a content point of view there is, however, little reason to do so within the next 3-5 years, and the network will wither away if unused for such a relatively long period. As discussed elsewhere, an attractive possibility should funding become available, would be to use the network for a sustained effort to fill identified gaps in knowledge and to generate new data in regions where scarce data is a problem. In that context, the possible future use of the database and data-handling system could also be looked into.</p>",nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,-1,,-1,,nap,,

The DRP has amply demonstrated the value of GEF Project support for transboundary river commissions. Critical to success is the relationship between the Project management and Commission Secretariat. These are not easy relationships to manage, since the Secretariat plays both a beneficiary role and a management role, while the PCU provides funding and technical support to the Secretariat, but also may pursue some outputs outside the scope of Secretariat responsibilities. If GEF project teams can get this relationship working well from the outset, as occurred with the DRP and ICPDR Secretariat, and can make a continuing effort throughout the project to maintain this relationship, such projects stand a real chance of achieving a high degree of success.<br />2. The DRP achieved considerable successes within the sphere of influence of the constituent members of the ICPDR delegations.

If GEF project teams can get this relationship working well from the outset, as occurred with the DRP and ICPDR Secretariat, and can make a continuing effort throughout the project to maintain this relationship, such projects stand a real chance of achieving a high degree of success. <br /><br />2) The project transformed an abstract concept of transboundary pollution into a neat package of recognizable problems. The identified polluting agents are clear and measurable causes of pollution. The project strengthened, as well, personal collaboration among the high-ranking officials of the various ministries. It is, therefore, possible to put a human face on an anonymous governmental decision.<br /><br />3) By first undertaking a training needs assessment, the DRP learned that training activities needed to build institutional capacities (ICPDR, DEF etc.) as well as to build technical capacities (nutrient reduction, wetland rehabilitation, reduction of toxic substances etc.) to assure the increase of knowledge and the capacity to act for water management and pollution control. The training needs assessment also served as the basis for prioritizing training needs given limited resources (human and financial).<br /><br />4) Increasing the public’s knowledge is a relatively easy task compared to the difficult task of changing the attitudes of beneficiaries.  A systematic evaluation of the message adoption rate should be included in environmental projects. This evaluation may help in selecting the best tools and media to transmit the message.  Also, it is critical to focus on developing appropriate public participation mechanisms and strategies given specific levels of activity (regional, national, sub-basin, local.)<br /><br />5) Expert Groups stand a strong chance of being successful when: (a) the countries fund their own contributions and participation; (b) the persons participating in the groups are indeed technical experts rather than senior managers; (c) there is low turnover of experts, allowing greater continuity and improving trust and communications across the participants.</p>","<p>1. A Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA) and a Strategic Action Program were completed and implemented.<br /><br />2. All Danube countries developed policies and legal instruments for sustainable water management and nutrient reduction.<br /><br />3. Nutrient loads to the Danube River (specifically nitrogen and phosphorous) were reduced, and water quality was improved.  The Black Sea benefitted from reduced Danube River nutrient levels, as well as the linkage and cooperation of these projects with the UNDP/GEF IW Black Sea projects</p>",,IW2,"<p>Output 2.1 sets expectations for inter-ministerial coordination (IMCM) and also identifies a set of special actions to enable Bosnia-Herzegovina to fully participate in the ICPDR and its EGs and to participate fully in the process of Danube region WFD implementation. <br />The BiH support was highly successful. Because of the federal / split system of governance in BiH, there was a real problem with ICPDR ands DRP coordination, which was effectively dealt with by the hiring of a country coordinator. Very much as a result of the support they received from the DRP, BiH was able to produce its first river analysis report and to contribute directly to the development of the Danube Roof Report, <br />The IMCM effort was generally successful. Analyses were carried out for ten countries and recommendations for six countries were subsequently agreed. There are no committees established in Moldova and Ukraine, although work is still in progress in Moldova.</p>",IW4,"<p>Output 1.1 involved support for implementation of the WFD as well as assistance to develop sub-basin initiatives for the Tisza and Sava rivers, as well as support to the ICPDR on upgrading their geographic information system (GIS) tools, and capacity building and training on biological sampling and analysis. The highlight of this effort is surely the work done in support of the ICPDR and together with the 13 Danube countries to produce the Danube ‘Roof Report’, (entitled The Danube River Basin District, Part A – Basin wide overview, 18 March 2005). The Roof Report has been highly acclaimed as the best of the transboundary reports presented to the EC under the WFD, and is a fine accomplishment for all participants. All told, there were 58 project activities carried out to assist the ICPDR and countries in their implementation of the WFD for the Danube.<br /><br />The DRP can also be praised for its achievements on the sub-basin initiatives, including political approval by all of the Sava riparian countries for a Framework Agreement for the Sava River Basin and the Sava River Commission, and completion of the Tisza river basin analysis report as the precursor to the Tisza WFD river basin management plan.<br />The DRP also met expectations with its assistance to the ICPDR for a Danube GIS Prototype.<br />Implementation of the Danube – Black Sea MOU is included as Output 2.5. Expectations were that this effort would enable a joint policy-making framework to be established and functioning in the DRB and Black Sea region for reduction of discharges of nutrients and hazardous substances into the Black Sea.<br /><br />Achievements (jointly with the BSERP) include the re-establishment of the joint technical working group, which held four annual meetings since 2002. There was also a Danube – Black Sea Strategic Partnership Stocktaking meeting organized in 2004, with participation of 80 high level country representatives of the ICPDR, BSC, GEF, UNDP and other experts. Close association of the DRP and BSERP efforts was greatly enhanced at the end of 2004 with the decision to appoint the DRP CTA as overall manager of both projects.</p>",IW4,<p>ICPDR</p>,IWA,"<p>• All ICPDR countries developed policies and legal instruments for sustainable water management and nutrient reduction. In particular, harmonisation with the European Union’s Water Framework Directive (WFD) became the driving force in the development of policies and legal instruments for improved water quality management. All of the Danube EU countries were establishing basin management plans and districts and agreed to issue a joint set of plans for the Danube. The non-EU countries indicated their interest to harmonise with the WFD requirements and most took initial legislative steps in this direction. <br />• Each country made progress in the areas of transboundary cooperation; improved water quality monitoring; emission control; emergency warning; accident prevention; and information management.</p>",IW4,,IW4,,nap,,nav,,nav,,0,,0,,nav,,"<p>Outputs 1.6 &amp; 1.7 provided technical assistance to the DRP countries in the area of tariffs and water pollution charges.

The effort also included development and testing of the Accounts Simulation for Tariffs and Effluent Charges (ASTEC) model that provides a tariff adjustment tool for municipal water and waste utilities.<br /><br />• 120 national small grant funded projects were launched, led by national environmental NGOs. There were also 12 regional small grant projects carried out, involving 35 NGOs working on transboundary problems.<br />• The Danube Environmental Forum was successfully re-activated and played useful roles as an ICPDR observer, a vehicle for public awareness raising, and an aide to NGOs across the region participating in the small grants programme.<br />• Public awareness of Danube environmental issues was raised through 100 articles in the regional and local media, more than 70 workshops bringing together more than 1,700 participants, and promotion of the annual Danube Day. <br />• Five pilot projects were managed, with manuals and training workshops developed for each; two study tours were held (US and Netherlands); two basin-wide workshops were carried out including 90 country representatives; and a final workshop was held. <br />• A set of 35 indicators for project monitoring and evaluation were developed and 14 indicators were tested and evaluated. <br />• A manual entitled Technical guidance on the integration of the nutrient reduction in riverine wetland management was produced.</p>"

Another important issue can be the introduction of integrated river basin management for water management and biodiversity due to the very important sources of Arctic pollution represented by the Russian big rivers. <br /><br />The project inventory of the Arctic territory hot spots is a suitable tool for the development of whole Russian inventory of pollution sources, legal and illegal waste disposal sites, contaminated sites. It can be use also for the development of institutional and financial mechanism to address past environmental damage using the USA Superfund as a model. <br /><br />The project tasks as well as the achieved results meet in full the tasks of the Arctic Council and its programs.

Establishment of the Dnipro Basin Commission. <br /><br />It is a common understanding that the International Dnipro Basin Commission (hereinafter – IDBC) to be established as stipulated by the Dnipro Agreement will not substitute or replace the existing institutional framework of bilateral cooperation in transboundary waters but rather be working in close cooperation with the latter. Thus it will foster, facilitate and coordinate efforts of the three riparian states and resolve those water, natural resources and ecosystem management issues which only the river basin commission is able to effectively resolve. At the same time, the IDBC will build upon the experience the riparian states already possess in establishing or participating in joint bodies on transboundary river basins, e.g. like ICPDR.<br /><br />2. Integral monitoring system/efficient information exchange mechanisms<br /><br />The monitoring systems currently implemented in Ukraine and Belarus are uneven, with the well-organized, but Soviet times indicators in Belarus, and scattered and largely ineffective system with no principle subject of monitoring in Ukraine. EU WFD compliant integral monitoring program with hydro-chemical, hydro-biological and hydro-morphological indicators regularly (though automated monitoring points) checked and accessible is crucial step to enable apt and timely managerial decisions.<br /><br />3. Relevant environmental legislation<br /><br />The project implementation revealed that in principal all the activities, including the implementation of cleaner production technologies, elaboration of EU-compliant monitoring programs and facilitation of the establishment of key managerial structures through drafting the respective statutory documents and calling regular national and regional working groups are largely of little efficiency if the respective norms and activities are not foreseen by the existing legislation of the riparian countries.

The objectives of the project embody a much longer term strategy which cannot be achieved, or finalised, in four years project but the foundations can be laid to monitor, restore and enhance the Gulf of Guinea ecosystem to provide increased potential for economic opportunities.<br />·The project attempted to be all encompassing and had many disparate activities. This was its strength and yet its weakness. These problems were pointed out in the 1998 „Assessment of Integrated Coastal Management in Africa‟ (UNEP Priority Actions Programme), which stated „how well the project achieved the aim of harmonising all its activities will become obvious when the project has its final evaluation.<br />·There were notable funding gaps in the project which allowed only token funding to be made in most of the project activities, particularly in GIS, pollution and living resources monitoring programme and the NGOs were all under funded. Problems related to the flow of funds are inherent in the UN system (there response time is far too slow). The problems, through lack of staff, in the Project Co-ordination Office, also meant that application for funding was delayed, which itself caused problems in funding certain Workshops (flow of funds did not match planning of activities). UNIDO was aware of some of these shortcomings and contributed by placing extra manpower from its own resources in the RCC.<br />·The enthusiasm with which policy makers, managers and experts have embraced the project, and thereby ensured its success, has meant that countries in general recognise the transboundary nature of some of the environmental and resource management problems that afflict them at the national level, and would readily embrace a common (regional) approach to their assessment and the formulation of their remedial actions.<br />·By involving the private sector in the project decision-making meetings and in the consultative processes, it has become evident that the private sector is anxious to be partners with Governments.<br />·Environmental and living resources management actions or interventions that are not community based are doomed to failure. They are more likely to succeed if the local communities around the sites of intervention are part of the consultative process and had a voice in the choice of actions, since this gives them a sense of ownership and by implication, engenders a sense of commitment to sustain the actions / interventions and obey the laws. NGOs by their very nature are steeped in such a participatory approach and therefore are more effective in reaching grassroots population (including settler communities and minors). They are therefore better placed to serve as vehicles for mass mobilisation and out-reach programs, with the help of Government structures where pertinent. Although NGOs participating in the project have proven to be able to attract additional funding for activities within the scope of the GOG-LME project, more adequate funds should have been reserved under the project to facilitate the important task assigned to them.<br />·The mission observed the lean structure of the RCC in Abidjan. It comprised a Regional Co-ordinator and an Associate Expert (who joined one and half years before the end of the project and was funded by UNIDO), a Personal Assistance and a driver The efficiency of the centre appeared highly satisfactory. However, to quote from the Ministerial Resolution from their First Meeting in July 1998 (Accra) “ adequate regional co-ordination structures should be put in place from the inception of phase 2 of the project, after consultations between the Ministers of Environments of the countries concerned”. This resolution embodies the sense of ownership, which the countries feel about the project and should be considered.<br />·Although co-operation among international organisations was foreseen as feasible and as necessary for the development and co-ordination of the project; the co-operation was less pronounced between UN agencies in some of the visited countries. However, in Ghana strong co-operation was noticed and could be taken as a template by itself of good and close co-operation. Other international organizations (either UN or other agencies) co-operated on bilateral or multilateral levels with the project. In most cases, a reporting system was maintained between NFPA and UNDP/UNIDO offices, however this co-operation needs to be strengthened.<br />·An outreach and capacity building oriented programme such as the GOG-LME Project should pay much attention to the distribution of information and lessons learnt through all channels accessible. The relevant national institutions, NGOs, the individual managers, policy makers and experts should therefore be involved, consulted and informed at all stages of project implementation. An intensive network of such partners becomes crucial, and should be maintained through workshops, activity groups, meetings, distribution of publications, newsletters, etc. and communication and information distribution through the internet. The funds allocated for maintaining such a network, for the printing of documentation and publications, etc. should therefore be substantial.<br />·Decision Support Systems based on a Geographical Information System are extremely useful tool to policy makers. An important objective of the project has therefore been the development of a basic information and decision support system. Despite this ambitious aim, however, funds allocated for such a resource intensive task were highly inadequate, and if were not for the strong country support received, this objective would not have reached a respectable level.</p>",,,nav,,nav,,IWA,,nav,,IWA,,IWA,,nap,,nav,,nav,,0,,0,,nav,,

Most of those consulted were totally unaware of the GEF focus on global environmental benefits.<br /><br />If projects are meant to address the root causes of identified problems, the OFM Project would have been expected to focus on monitoring, enforcement of regulations and capacity building (mainly training) for surveillance. There is no denying that the OFM Project did indeed address these aspects, however, they were not its main focus. According to the Evaluation Team’s Terms of Reference, the Key Pilot Activities of the OFM Project centered predominantly on preparation for and participation in the MHLCs and the PrepCons together with scientific research for management. This is evident in the proportions of the budget spent on these activities – 56% in the case of the MHLCs and PrepCons (FFA) and 47% in the case of scientific research (SPC) respectively.<br /><br />Project design, at least for the OFM Component was weak, hence the need to make significant changes to the Objective, Outputs and Activities. It is evident that this was an amalgam of two distinct initiatives brought together purely as a matter of convenience. No synergies between the two components were planned and none were created during implementation.<br /><br />The ProDoc fell short of expectations. It did not provide adequate guidance to those implementing the OFM project; it did not build on past achievements and learn from past experiences; project design did not seem to  identify problem situations adequately and their root causes; it was weak in terms of strategic planning,preparatory work and implementation strategies; having identified some risks it provided no risk management strategies; it failed to unify the two components and no synergies were planned.<br /><br />The importance of full and comprehensive stakeholder consultation and input in Project design.<br /><br />Ensure that the ProDoc identifies both potential risks and measures to be taken to minimize or manage risks.<br /><br />The LogFrame Matrices, both the original and the revised one, have created confusion with their loose use of terminology and the lack of logical structure. <br /><br />The Evaluation Team feels that the original objective for the OFM Component could not have been expected to be achieved by this project since its dimensions went beyond the boundaries of the project. On the other hand, the Evaluation Team believes that the new, revised objective has been achieved, even though there is a feeling that it might have been retrofitted to an existing and/or developing programme of work of the executing agencies.<br /><br />The Outputs targeted by the project were not clearly identified and were in fact referred to as Activities.<br /><br />For monitoring to be useful and effective, it must be two-way, there must be feedback.<br /><br />The Evaluation Team feels that the budget allocated to the FFA has been spent appropriately and while only a small proportion was spent ‘in-country’, it was almost totally spent for the benefit of the countries.<br /><br />The relative proportions of expenditure between administration, equipment, training and consultancies appear weighted in favour of the latter, however, this is to be expected in a project which had such a strong focus on capacity building and the project has been good value for money.<br /><br />By “investing” its resources in a body like SPC whose OFP had on-going research activities directly related to the aims and objectives of the OFM Project; and in the FFA whose fisheries management activities mirrored and extended those proposed under the OFM Project, GEF has benefited from a broader input of expertise and resources which would not have been available otherwise. <br /><br />It would seem that a lesson from this experience is the advantage of working through or investing in regional organizations (as Executing Agencies) that have a strong track record in the relevant areas and a high level of complementarity (and linkages) between the Project and their existing work programmes.<br /><br />It was essential that roles and responsibilities were defined clearly, and this appears to have been the case. <br /><br />The OFM Component did not involve partnerships with any third-party donors. Funds came from GEF, FFA and SPC. However, there was a high degree of complementarity between the activities of the OFM Component and other activities being undertaken by FFA and SPC but funded by other donors.<br /><br />The original Objective 4 included an Activity to create a public participation programme aimed at key stakeholders for the OFM Component of the IW-Project. This intention was first revised and watered down and then, by the latest revision of the LogFrame Matrix, there was no mention of public participation<br />whatsoever.<br /><br />As noted by SPC, stakeholder involvement in the OFM Project has been fairly weak in most aspects of the Project. However, FFA felt that the outputs of the Project have been country driven through their influence in the FFC. <br /><br />The Evaluation Team acknowledges that securing direct participation in a meaningful way is a challenge for an oceanic fisheries project, but with minor exceptions, all Government level stakeholders said that they would welcome more opportunities to be directly involved.<br /><br />In spite of the potential problems which could have resulted from the numerous hierarchical layers mentioned elsewhere, implementation of the OFM Component was comparatively smooth and effective. The views of stakeholders and beneficiaries on implementation arrangements have been positive in the main. <br /><br />While implementation appears to have been satisfactory, coordination has not been strong. The Evaluation Team notes that apart from the handling of financial reports and cash advances, neither SPREP nor the PCU made enough effort to coordinate between the two components of the IW-Project at the implementation level.<br /><br />The OFM component targeted primarily those responsible for developing and implementing effective fisheries management regimes at the national and<br />regional levels.<br /><br />The ProDoc identified “secondary target beneficiaries” which included intergovernmental organisations (namely SPC, FFA and SPREP) and the private sector. It is important to remember that benefits to FFA and SPC as organizations are only a means to an end and that the ultimate beneficiaries should be the people and Governments of the Pacific Island States.<br /><br />There is a slight misunderstanding regarding ‘sustainability’. The FFA and SPC appear to think of sustainability as the continuation of the project itself rather than the survival of the project results after the project has ended. They therefore see the proposed follow-up project as a sign of sustainability. The Evaluation Team feels that the need for a follow-up project is almost an indication that the project results are unlikely to be sustained without this further intervention.<br /><br />Capacity building has been the most significant benefit of the OFM Project. But in spite of the impressive nature of the results, their sustainability is not assured. Some of the barriers to sustainability have been identified and those that are within the Project’s competence are proposed to be addressed during the Phase II Project. The Evaluation Team believes that a follow-up project will be an effective means for GEF to secure and ensure sustainability for the investment it has made in the global oceanic resources of the region.<br /><br />Both FFA and SPC considered the quarterly financial and narrative reporting as somewhat excessive and would suggest that 6-monthly and annual reporting and annual work plans would be more effective. This would allow a more detailed approach to assessing progress to be taken.<br /><br />The Evaluation Team does not believe that monitoring and evaluation have been used effectively as a management tool in obtaining accountability or measuring progress or in directing the implementation of the OFM Component and cannot recommend this approach for any future project support.<br /><br />1) Prepare a succinct Project Document and thorough Logical Framework over a shorter, continuous process of research, consulting, planning and drafting, with continuity of leadership from SAP to Project planning and implementing.<br /><br />2) Allow sufficient time and process for key stakeholder participation to adequately explore and express perspectives on priorities, problems to be tackled, causes and effects, possible solutions and alternative ways of implementing solutions.<br /><br />3) Set only the broad framework, main strategies and essential principles; avoid detailed prescriptions; allow project implementation to be a continual process of pilot exercises, formative evaluation, adaptive management and learning.</p>","<p>1.

Increasing the knowledge is relatively easy task in comparison to changing human's attitudes. The sustainability of environmental<br />projects depends on how much public, business community and decision-makers have learned about the project achievements and to what extent they are ready to change their attitude toward the environment. The success in the message transmission and its adoption by the population depends on many factors such as local cultures, traditions and taboos. The projects should systematically monitor the results of their actions. To preserve experience in this domain the<br />projects may maintain a database of information transmission techniques and their success.<br />Capacity building. Many projects help national staff in new skills and knowledge acquisition. However, there are few occasions to evaluate the use of the acquired knowledge after the project termination. The present project trained many national staff in biodiversity data collection, pollution monitoring or environmental training. The personnel were predominantly employed by governmental or state sponsored institutions that have been strengthened by the project. It would be useful for the GEF to evaluate the impact of the trained persons on the national institutions.<br />Make research applied. Previous projects employing scientific staff frequently experience difficulties in taking full profit from the research results. The specific<br />answers containing in the research papers are too narrow to be applied, the general solution advanced by scientist are frequently to impractical. It seems that<br />the present project experienced similar difficulties with respect to many of the scientific documents produced by the consultants. Periodic meetings of the<br />research staff with the managerial one may be helpful in generating constructive and practical approaches.</p>",,,nav,,IW2,"<p>The project produced a draft of the Convention on the sustainable management of the Lake which represents a joint effort of senior lawyers, policy makers and key technicians from the riparian countries. As the SAP, the Convention is a participatory effort of the Lake Tanganyika riparian countries. Once signed, the Convention will become a framework for other national legislation concerning Lake Tanganyika environment protection. The country delegates expect that it will lead to other national legislation adjustments. The Convention provisions about environmental impact assessment, public awareness building and public participation in the decision making process, are new in these countries and will probably impact other domains of public life.<br />The Convention draft produced by the riparian countries delegates after extensive national consultations is another great project achievement.<br />The Convention will be binding for the riparian states. However, the Lake may be endangered by activities or events that occur in other countries situated in the lake proximity.<br /><br />Legal component evaluation<br />The objective to formulate a regional legal framework has been achieved. A Draft Convention has been submitted as a working document for formal political<br />negotiations, signature, ratification and implementation by the four riparian countries. It is important to note that the Draft Convention reflects international<br />standard of law-making and, at the same time, is based on a consensus among the four countries.<br /><br />The Draft Convention has been prepared with the involvement of the national governments of the four riparian states Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo,<br />Tanzania and Zambia. The national governments through lawyers from various concerned ministries provided the necessary feedback to the drafters. The<br />present Draft appears to be accepted by the governmental institutions involved in the process. At the 6th Steering Committee Meeting it became clear that these governmental institutions are prepared to mobilize more support for the Draft Convention at the national levels through further consultations with other<br />concerned ministries and departments. An indicator of such commitment also is the support of the Strategic Action Program which provides for provisional institutional arrangements at the regional level. It can, therefore, be concluded that the governments will do all necessary, so that formal negotiations on the Draft Convention may start very soon.</p>",IW1,,nav,"<p>According to the declaration of the interviewed countries' delegates, the countries are committed to implementing the SAP according to the guidelines of the<br />Convention. Implementation of this commitment requires SAP approval by technical ministries and development planning authorities within the countries.<br />The formal approval would require the signing of the Convention by the respective governments.<br />The countries' representatives stressed, that although for the time being there is no major direct government investment in realization of the objectives designed by the project, the project only recently started to propose specific actions to implement. In fact, the SAP was proposed for consideration to the Steering Committee less than one month ago. In the meantime, the countries' governments provided the project with requested facilities and detached its staff to participate in the project's launched activities and organized meetings.<br />In fact, the results of the project's findings show that support of the proposed actions is not only a matter of commitment to ecological ethics or a will to<br />preserve biodiversity, but the easiest way to assure the habitants of the Lake shores decent living conditions.</p>",IW2,,IW2,"<p>In general, the project was very successful in executing the activities that were independent (or almost independent) of the local security conditions. The process of drafting the Strategic Action Program was an example of this efficiency. The preliminary draft of the plan was produced as early as 1996. It was subsequently improved and replaced by one that was extensively discussed in national workshops. In fact, the project provided the national groups (purposely created to discuss the plan) with GEF guidelines and assistance assuring regional coherence of this document. The Lake threats diagnosis, and the protection plan were produced by national technicians and decision makers. Creation of conditions allowing national ownership of the Strategic Action Program is one of<br />the project's greatest achievements. The Program, however, was drafted and finalized well before the final write-up of the specific studies. As a consequence,<br />the technical (or scientific) justification of many of the envisaged actions is not as specific as it could be.<br /><br />Both the TDA, SAP and the Diagnosis are at the stage where they indicate the actions and rank them in priority order. Such a regionally agreed upon inventory<br />of Lake protection priorities is a great and lasting achievement of the project. It is also an example for other regions facing a similar need to produce a common<br />international coherent environment protection program. There is, however, a need for the next steps that will assure implementation of the program: endorsement of the priorities by the governments, incorporation of the Plan into the national development and investment programs, preparation of specific<br />implementation proposals and investment projects2. These actions should be assured after the project termination (According to the initial project's work plan, beginning implementation of these investments should take place before the project termination; however, the implementation delays and difficult<br />humanitarian situation of the region delayed the project's program implementation.)</p>",nap,,nav,,nav,,0,,0,,nav,,"<p>The Inception Report stressed the importance of involving local people at the start in project activities.

In general, the objective was achieved and all tasks completed although with some delays caused by the external factors. The level of completion could be considered within the range of 85-90 % based on the expert assessment and the stakeholders’ estimation. The draft of LBMP was completed only in the 4th Quarter of 2005 that left no time for its partial implementation. However, some project activities greatly contributed to the agreed actions under the Programme (for example, joint monitoring etc.). The Nutrient Reduction Plan started as scheduled but also experienced the delay due to the<br />extension of the two satellite projects, i.e. the EC Life Environment Viru-Peipsi CAMP project (Estonia) till September 2005 and the EU Tacis CBC Baltic Line 2000 project “Environmental Management of Lake Chudskoe” till the end of 2005. Both projects are further referred as LIFE project (Estonia) and the EC Tacis project (Russia). The UNDP/GEF project expected significant inputs from those two satellite projects both for the TDA, Monitoring Programme and the LBMP. The delays had a serious impact on the timeliness and quality of this component. Despite the earlier signs and preconditions, this risk was underestimated even after the mid-term evaluation with no contingency plan set. The TDA was prepared by Akvaplan- NIVA A/S in cooperation with other institutions from Estonia and Russia in February 2005. Since the satellite projects were still on-going it brought certain limitations to apply to full extent the final data, findings and recommendations drawn by those projects and relevant to the UNDP/GEF project. Whilst preparing the TDA there was still an uncertainty related to the pollution sources and loads from the Russian part of the Lake Peipsi due to the delay with the EU Tacis project implementation. The draft of Monitoring Programme was developed in the 3rd Quarter of 2004. There were three joint expeditions carried out in 2003 and 2004. Furthermore, previous joint monitoring results were used for data analysis. The Draft Monitoring Programme was sent to the officials for the comments and feedback in order to improve the quality of monitoring. The results are still pending. To summarize, a lot of work was done to reach this objective. Nevertheless, the official approval of both the LBMP and Monitoring Programme and as well as their partial implementation did not occur during the project life span. Two feasibility studies (on eco-farming and eco-tourism) were completed in 2005 on both sides of the lake in order to evaluate potential development in this field and possible negative effects on water quality. For Estonia, the eco-farming feasibility study was also supported by an introductory level of farmers’ training on environment and pollution issues. Different sites for eco-farming were assessed and identified for crop potential.<br />On the Russian side, the eco-farming pilot project encompassing an assessment of impact made by agriculture on the Lake Peipsi, and eco-farming concept development could be considered fully completed. The research included the analysis of the available sites, current utilization of the agricultural lands, recent developments in plants cultivation and livestock breeding, fertilizers use, assessment of forest reserves and others. Under the eco-tourism study, some cities, towns, and areas were assessed and prioritized for potential eco-tourism development based on the local surveys. The concept of eco-tourism development was based on eight mainstreams of tourism development. In fact, this concept served as the basis of the overall Lake Peipsi ecotourism development plan to be developed and implemented under the LBMP. <br /><br />INDICATOR #2:  National and local institutional capacity to implement the Management Plan strengthened.  [Target: Capacity raised and support provided.]<br /><br />• Governments, NGOs, and other stakeholders became fully engaged in preparation and implementation of the Management Programme.<br />• Via more than 20 events, the Joint Water Commission, two national water authorities, five monitoring entities, and four regional and ten local environmental bodies were trained.  <br />• More than 30 NGOs and local grassroots groups have received project support. <br />• Networking, cooperation, and communication of the Joint Commission with other relevant commissions and organizations have been increased. <br />• The Lake Peipsi/Chudskoe Forum was supported as an institutional network that incorporates agencies and stakeholders at different levels of governance across the border to promote a dialogue on water management and transboundary cooperation issues.<br /><br /><br />INDICATOR #3: An information, education and communication system developed and launched.  [Target: Disseminate information via Internet, project publications and special events; create a Lake museum.]<br /><br />• The Peipsi portal and project web-site were created in 2003.  <br />• More than ten publications, including ones on the lake’s fishes, birds, wildlife, eutrophication, etc., were distributed with total reprints of up to 5000 copies.  <br />• Educational programs have been integrated into Estonian and Russian curricula.  <br />• The Lake Peipsi museum has been established, with a building in Estonia and a virtual museum in Russia.</p>"

The regionalapproach can also help to effectively coordinate the dissemination and replication of lessons learned duringimplementation of country-specific components. Furthermore, the regional approach fosters a competitiveenvironment between countries, providing benchmarks that inspire greater performance on a national level. A regional approach may also facilitate regional compliance on international treaty issues, such asMARPOL 73/78 in this project.<br />· Project components must have a built in flexibility and realistic time table when dealing withmultiple countries with varying development capacities and needs. Flexibility can be achieved through a demand-driven approach. In this project, the change to a demand-driven approach had a positive impact on implementation, as countries felt they could seek assistance that best fit their needs. Possible demand-driven processes could also have been useful for the procurement of equipment. It should be noted that if faced with a similar situation today, the Bank might consider a regional Adaptable Program Loan (APL), as was done for the multi-country HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Program. Furthermore, future projects involving multiple donors and countries will require appropriate sequencing for project activities and realistic time tables to account for the inherent complexity of a regional project.<br />· The provision for a Regional Coordinating Unit (RCU) is a useful method that facilitates project supervision for multiple country projects. The RCU in this project was able to provide key regional leadership that ensured regional coordination and consistency in approaches to solid waste management issues. In addition, the RCU provided crucial guidance to countries on Bank procedures and procurement which were important in helping to move implementation forward. It was also essential that the RCU maintained a separate project component with funding tied to it, to provide it with some leverage in dealing with national implementation units.<br />· Public awareness and education are essential in building support for major changes. Public awareness not only may help to ease difficult transitions, such as the move of government salaried employees and functions from the ministries to the SWMEs, but it can also lead to a higher level of achievement of outcome objectives. In this project, the public’s efforts to change old habits of disposing of their garbage on the roadside helped to increase the impact of the project. This was only achieved when community groups took it upon themselves to organize clean-up campaigns. Public awareness campaigns are relatively inexpensive methods for inducing significant change in community behavior.<br />· Importance of balancing regional standardization and potential efficiency gains with country specific needs to ensure full benefits of joint procurement: Joint procurement can provide benefits in an operational setting such as the OECS, including economies of scale, harmonization, speed of processing documentation, and efficient use of limited human and financial resources. However, experience in this project suggests that these benefits must be balanced with specific country concerns, situations and capacities.<br />· Dealing with sub-national island systems: Project design and implementation needs to take into account countries that are made up of multiple islands of different size, capacity and development needs. Mechanisms should be put in place to ensure that implementing agencies based on the main islands actively<br />supervise project activities on the smaller ones. In project design, more thought should be given to tailoring equipment and civil works procurement, taking into account the specific technical needs of the smaller islands in multiple island nations.</p>",,,nav,,nav,,nav,,nav,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,-1,,-1,,nap,,

It is not likely that this project, involving countries with highly unequal capacities, would have been implemented successfully without the personal involvement of a particularly competent and energetic project coordinator. His understanding of both the political and environmental issues in the region, and his ability to communicate with the officials of all four island states facilitated project implementation. The IOC, whose mandate is to represent the interests of the four island states, also played an important role in maintaining the dialogue among the participating countries and in giving the project a high profile.<br />Obtaining government commitment during project preparation to specific arrangements for institutional and financial sustainability, and continuing to focus on the issue during implementation, helps to ensure that project investments will be sustained after the project closes. A study of institutional and financial sustainability was produced during project preparation that identified options for governments’ consideration. An update of the study following the midterm<br />review further refined the recommendations. A condition of Board presentation was that all governments commit to adopting mechanisms for sustainability, and all ultimately fulfilled this commitment.<br />Building effective partnerships with relevant organizations, industry, and governments of non-beneficiary countries can help significantly improve project design and implementation. The IMO, IPIECA, the oil and shipping industry, and the governments of South Africa and France (Réunion) all participated in designing the project, offering the insights of experience and expertise. The involvement of these entities in project preparation also led to definition of their roles and responsibilities during project implementation.<br />Being clear early during project preparation on the scope and nature of partners’ participation can help prevent conflicts later. The IMO could have made it clear early during preparation that it expected to play a significant role during implementation and that it expected to be paid for its services. Instead it made this clear only after appraisal was complete and its role and responsibilities laid out in the PAD. At this stage governments had already agreed to the design and did not wish to reopen the discussions. Dissatisfied, the IMO then refused to participate in project implementation. Although relations later improved and IMO returned as a partner, this conflict could have been prevented had agreement been reached early during preparation on the roles and responsibilities of the various partners.<br />Pairing weaker countries with stronger ones in a regional project can help to quickly build the capacity of the weaker ones. Mauritius and Seychelles, with much greater capacity, shared their knowledge and experience with Comoros and Madagascar. Being part of a regional plan provided a strong incentive for Comoros and Madagascar to build capacity, even during periods of political uncertainty.</p>",,"<p>The project design is being replicated in the follow-on Western Indian Ocean Marine Electronic Highway and Coastal and Marine Protection Project. The East African coastal states of Mozambique, Tanzania, and Kenya have requested to be included in the regional oil spill contingency plan as a means of fulfilling their obligations under the Nairobi Convention. Parties to this convention agree to cooperate in responding to pollution emergencies in the convention area and to reduce or eliminate pollution or the threat of pollution, and to this end to develop and promote, individually and jointly, contingency plans for responding to incidents involving pollution or the threat of pollution. This is a very positive outcome, given that the project was developed with replicability in mind.</p>",nav,,IW4,"<p>Component 1: Legislation and regulation for conventions (US$477,000 revised to US$222,000)<br />Achievement of the objectives of the project is rated satisfactory. While the project’s development and global objectives were broad, which makes measuringe impacts difficult, the project has clearly helped to protect the environmental integrity of the coastal and marine ecosystems of the western Indian Ocean, and to limit the contamination of international waters by supporting the creation and maintenance of capacity to respond to oil spills. The project achieved all of its specific objectives. Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, and Seychelles have ratified CLC92, FUND92, and OPRC90. Comoros, Mauritius, and Seychelles in addition ratified the MARPOL 73/78 convention. All four counties have translated the provisions of the conventions into national legislation and regulations. All countries have established national capacity to respond to an oil spill, preparing and testing national oil spill contingency plans. The oil and shipping industries have played an active role in preparing and testing the national plans, and intend to actively participate in responding to oil spills. All countries now have adequate oil spill response equipment to cover their major ports. The wide distribution of equipment also ensures that the time required to respond to a spill is minimal. The project generated widespread public awareness throughout the region of the threat of oil spills and of the means to address them, assuring public support for taxes to maintain capacity. All four countries have identified mechanisms to finance periodic oil spill exercises, maintain and replenish equipment, and update oil spill contingency plans and manuals. The regional plan has been prepared and tested. Countries of the region know their responsibilities and roles in the event of an emergency and how to mobilize the assistance of neighboring countries and the oil and shipping industries should the need arise. A regional center has been established in Madagascar with financing from the French Cooperation. At the time the project closed, its staff had been appointed and equipment procured, but a permanent location to house the center had yet to be identified. No major spills had occurred in the region since implementation of the project began. Small Tier 1 oil spills did occur in the Port Louis harbor in Mauritius and in Fort Dauphin in Madagascar during project implementation, and all were effectively addressed without causing significant damage.</p>",IW2,"<p>Component 5: Regional institutional strengthening (US$1 million revised to US$1.2 million)<br />Outputs of this component are satisfactory. A regional plan to coordinate countries’ response to an oil spill has been prepared and by the time the project closed had been tested twice through joint exercises. The regional plan has been significantly strengthened by drawing on the expertise of the industry and<br />government of South Africa in responding to oil spills for its preparation. Some details of the cooperative agreements have still to be fully articulated, such as the arrangements for clearing equipment through customs. The withdrawal of Seychelles’s offer to host the regional coordination center on the grounds that its distant location from the other islands would make coordination of regional activities difficult led to a delay of nearly two years in establishing the center. The center was finally established in Madagascar in early 2004. Staff have been appointed, and equipment to operate the center has been procured. However, at the time the project closed a suitable office for the center was being identified. French Cooperation has agreed to finance the initial start-up costs of the center and operational costs for its first years of operation. The rationale for choosing Madagascar to host the regional coordination center is not clear. Some stakeholders have expressed concern that Madagascar does not have sufficient capacity to effectively coordinate countries’ response to an oil spill, and believe that either Mauritius or Réunion would be more suitable locations for the center. Some observers argue that the regional coordination center with a<br />full-time staff is not necessary. Instead the responsibilities of a regional coordinator could be added to those of a national coordinator.</p>",nav,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,-1,,-1,,nap,,

Mobilisation of scientific expertise in support of environmental management<br />WIO-LaB succeeding in engaging more than 500 experts, practitioners and other stakeholders in the development of the SAP and TDA through the regional and national working group structure, based on experience generated by an International Waters project in the South China Seas, and through other deliberate efforts including creation of the Forum of Heads of Academic and Research Institutions (FARI) and associated Scientific and Technical review Panel and support to the Consortium for Conservation of the Coastal and Marine Ecosystems in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO-C).<br />WIO-LaB‘s consultative approach has generated a high level of ownership of the TDA and SAP and effectively mobilised the regional scientific community in support of a management and sustainable development. This was a cost-effective approach that could be replicated in the design of regional science-based environmental projects requiring multi-disciplinary input at a regional scale.<br />B. Allow plenty of time for policy development<br />Allowing sufficient time for in depth consultation and legal review of the text of Protocol for the Protection of the Marine and Coastal Environment of the Western Indian Ocean from Land-based Sources and Activities resulted in a more robust and better adapted text that was owned and championed by the National Focal Points. Participants appreciated the extended consultative process to develop of the Protocol and have indicated that this should be seen as a model for further development of the Convention.<br />This positive lesson from experience has been highlighted in view of its immediate applicability in the context of further development of the Protocol, in view of the decision taken at the Sixth Conference of Parties to the Nairobi Convention to explore development of an ICZM protocol.<br />C. Work with champions within the wider framework of their host organisations<br />Much of the success of WIO-LaB can be attributed to the dedication of the national focal points whose roles spanned governance, coordination and oversight, policy development, and in some cases direct management of project activities such as the demonstration projects. The project relied strongly on the NFPs ability to perform these tasks effectively in a context where institutional support was highly variable amongst different countries. A number of NFPs were reassigned during the course of the project and some cases this was associated with loss of continuity and institutional memory particularly where the WIO-LaB project as a whole or a demonstration project had been strongly identified with an individual.<br />It is unlikely that the issue of a projects‘ dependence on key individuals or champions can be resolved in the immediate future. However, the issues of continuity and support in future projects could be addressed by ensuring that senior managers in host institutions are fully briefed on individual‘s responsibilities, are kept appraised of developments, and are aware of the need to ensure an effective handover if staff are reassigned.<br />D. Use regional frameworks but distinguish project implementation from core business<br />The WIO-LaB project benefitted strongly from being embedded in the policy framework, governance mechanisms and from extensive experience of operating in the region offered by Convention and its Secretariat, while at the same time it contributed to raising the profile of the Convention in the WIO region. The project was integrated into the workplan of the Convention. At times it became necessary to distinguish between project-related activities and the regular business of the Convention in order to clarify the extent to which the project could be expected to support the Convention‘s wider programme of work particularly where there was a shared policy interest in an activity such as a meeting.<br />The confusion related to responsibilities was rooted in the limited specification of implementation arrangements and weak and sometimes confusing definition of roles and responsibilities in the project document and may have been exacerbated by changing supervision arrangements during the course of the project.<br />The need to distinguish core business from project activities through clear definition of roles and responsibilities and implementation arrangements is of relevance for future definition and implementation of projects in contexts where project execution is linked to larger ongoing initiatives that have separate funding sources and independent work programme preparation processes.<br />E. Allocate sufficient funding for translation<br />The budget allocation for translation of documents was not sufficient to allow translation of the projects technical outputs nor of key working documents (such as legal texts) produced during the course of the project. This has limited the accessibility and usefulness of products in the francophone and lusophone countries of the WIO region and in some cases affected their participation project activities.<br />The simple lesson for design of projects in multi-lingual regions is to ensure that sufficient resources are allocated in project budgets for translation of documents and technical outputs.</p>","<p>1.

Successful completion of six demonstration projects. Two of  the projects namely:  Municipal Waste Water Management at Shimo La Tewa Prison using wetland-lagoon system in Kenya, and Stormwater/Wastewater drainage and treatment using a lagoon/constructed wetland system on Pemba Island in Tanzania, have introduced very successful  cost effective  approaches in the management of municipal wastewater for urban population of up to 5,000 and 20,000 respectively at an affordable cost.<br />3.

The WIO-LaB project combined foundational activities focusing on policy, regulatory frameworks, and national priority setting and relevant capacity development with demonstration activities focusing on capacity development, and technical and managerial innovation. It also helped to introduce a new strategic approach at national level in the form of NPAs.<br />70. The project highlighted the economic rationale for taking preventative action to limit negative impacts of LBSA on the marine and coastal environment. At the same time the project piloted a range of cost-effective solutions for reducing or preventing impacts through the demonstration projects.<br />71. The project largely worked within existing institutional structures of the Nairobi Convention and national inter-ministerial coordination mechanisms associated with ICZM or environmental management. At regional level it helped reinforce the institutional framework for implementation of the Nairobi Convention by providing a forum for practical engagement of the Convention‘s National Focal Points (NFPs) who also served as focal points for the project. At the national level the project breathed new life into inter-ministerial coordination mechanisms including where necessary through provision of financial support for operating costs.<br />72. The project contributed substantially to policy development at regional level through the LBSA Protocol and at national level through development of NPAs. It strengthened the building blocks for policy implementation including through by building capacity of institutions and individuals.<br />73. Follow-on funding by government and donors is discussed under financial sustainability. The adoption of the LBSA Protocol, endorsement of the SAP and development of NPAs have established a justification and rationale for mainstreaming of activities into government functions and for further project based investment.<br />74. The NFPs served as individual champions for the project and their ability to convene other actors and coordinate activities was central to progress at the national level. Further champions included senior staff in the national focal point institutions (NFPIs) and project coordinators in the NFPIs or partner organizations. A number of NFPs and other champions were reassigned during the course of the project, sometimes moving to strategic roles. In some cases this was associated with loss of continuity and institutional memory particularly where the WIO-LaB project as a whole, or a demonstration project, had been strongly identified with an individual.</p>",III2,,III1,"<p>INDICATOR#3: Protocol for the Protection of the Marine and Coastal Environment of the Western Indian Ocean from Land Based Sources and Activities (LBSA Protocol) with annexes available by middle of year 1.<br />RESULT: Development and negotiation of the LBSA Protocol by December 2009.

The institutional framework and governance mechanisms established or employed by the project at regional and national level are favourable in terms of allowing for the project outcomes/benefits to be sustained.<br />63. The WIO-LaB project was implemented under the umbrella of the Nairobi Convention and was a vehicle for delivery of part of the Convention‘s Programme of Work agreed by its Conference of Parties. This ensured the project was strongly embedded in the political and institutional framework of the Convention. The Nairobi Convention framework allowed the project to engage with France (La Réunion) and Somalia who took part as observers in later Project Steering Committee (PSC) meetings. Somalia‘s regular participation from 2007 was welcomed in PSC meeting decisions as part of a wider concerted effort to assist Somalia to participate more actively in Nairobi Convention Activities.<br />64. The project itself helped to raise the profile of the Convention within the WIO region, including within the parent ministries of the national focal point institutions (NFPIs) and amongst other ministries and agencies as well as with regional bodies such as the Indian Ocean Commission. The recent increase in member contributions to the Convention has been attributed to this visibility and associated recognition of the practical value and relevance of the Convention process.<br />65. A key result of the project and mechanism for follow up at the regional level is the Protocol for the Protection of the Marine and Coastal Environment of the Western Indian Ocean from Land-based Sources and Activities adopted in April 2010 by the Conference of Plenipotentiaries to the Nairobi Convention, and signed by eight countries including six of the eight WIO-LaB project partners. The Protocol includes provision ‗to develop and adopt procedures and mechanism to assess and promote compliance with and enforcement of this protocol.‘<br />66. National plans of action (NPAs) were prepared by Tanzania, South Africa, Seychelles, Kenya, Comoros and Madagascar either as stand-alone plans (Tanzania and South Africa) or integrated into wider coastal zone or environmental management strategies.

There remain strong differences amongst the WIO countries in terms of capacity and technical know-how to implement measures foreseen by the LBSA Protocol, and the need for increased human resources was recognised when the Protocol was adopted.

Country management units’ and country offices’ increased involvement in project supervision is critical for the regional projects’ success.<br />In the absence of a strong regional institution, development assistance should focus foremost on capacity building and institutional strengthening of the Recipient, rather than attempting to resolve or bypass the institution’s shortcomings by introducing outside agencies for project management and execution.<br />Joint project implementation through two GEF implementation agencies (i.e. World Bank and UNDP) requires that roles and responsibilities of the two agencies during project implementation are clearly elaborated and agreed upon in advance, with key reporting and supervision processes harmonized.<br />The Bank should be realistic regarding project implementation planning, the time it takes to complete a project of this challenging nature, and the outcome targets to be achieved.</p>",<p>1.

Comprehensive national and regional diagnostic reports on legal, institutional, economic and financial aspects of the transboundary management of shared land and water resources of the Basin have been prepared.. These reports complement the development and implementation of the SAP. Recommendations focused on: (i) creating transboundary IWRM Committees; (ii) harmonizing and completing the national legal frameworks through an integrated approach regarding the various uses of water, land and the environment; (iii) creating of the LCB Observatory to monitor water resources, environmental, economic, socio-economic and other aspects relevant to an implementation of IWRM; and (iv) capacity building to promote IWRM. Though national legal and institutional frameworks are yet to be harmonized, each Member State has committed to ensure that its body of laws and regulations will be coordinated and supportive of environmental policies developed through the NAP/SAP process. The NAPs, the main foundation of the SAP, were prepared based on an assessment of national priority areas of concern, including regional concerns identified in the TDA. Each country has developed<br />objectives and targets, proposed interventions and elaborated a resource mobilization strategy to address their objectives.</p>",IW3,"<p>INDICATOR 2. LCBC has been reformed, is operating more effectively and its capacity to sustainably develop LCB resources has been strengthened according to an endorsed IA.<br />The Institutional Assessment (IA) was endorsed in the Extraordinary CoM (June 2008). CBOs and local stakeholders proposed and implemented projects addressing local concerns. National teams developed the National Action Programs for the implementation of IWRM.<br /><br />The Institutional Assessment of LCBC was completed and endorsed by the member countries. The IA report contains 34 recommendations aimed at reforming LCBC into a reinvigorated, product-oriented institution. These recommendations call inter alia for the preparation of a Biennial State of the Lake Chad Basin Ecosystem Report and the establishment of: (i) a regionally-based data and information system - the Lake Chad Basin Observatory - as part of LCBC‟s capacity to undertake a systematic monitoring role for the natural resources of the basin; (ii) a Water Resources Experts Committee (WRC) comprised of senior level water resources specialists from the Member States; (iii) an Environment, Science and Planning Committee (ESPC) to provide needed scientific capacity to the LCBC; (iv) a Donor Consultative Committee (DCC) to facilitate continued donor involvement and investment in the work of the LCBC, and (v) a Staff Development Fund providing professional development opportunities for recruiting and retaining high quality staff. The IA also recommends upgrading and strengthening the fiduciary capacities of LCBC and improving its overall accountability to Member States and other contributors. Due to the late endorsement of the IA (June 2008), the project was not in a position to support the implementation of these reforms of LCBC. It should be noted, however, that the GTZ is currently supporting the LCBC in the implementation of these reforms. GTZ supported LCBC in elaborating an Action Program for the implementation of the IA. This Action Program was endorsed during the last CoM held in Nigeria on May7-8, 2009.</p>",nav,,IW4,"<p>A comprehensive Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA) was completed at national and regional levels. The TDA analysis was conducted through a participatory process and presents the transboundary problems as identified and prioritised by the basin stakeholders. The TDA identifies three overarching root causes of the transboundary problems caused by unsustainable resources use practices, i.e. (i) the absence of sustainable development on the political agendas of the riparian countries, (ii) low standards of environmental education and awareness, and (iii) population pressure. The regional TDA identified seven priority regional environmental concerns, as follows: (i) the variability of the hydrological regime and fresh water availability, (ii) water pollution, (iii) decreased viability of biological resources, (iv) the loss of biodiversity, (v) the loss and modification of ecosystems, (vi) sedimentation in rivers and water bodies, and (vii) the presence of invasive species. The TDA highlights the need to pay special attention to institutional reform of LCBC as the bedrock for arresting the degradation trends in the Basin. LCBC lacks the power to arbitrate water conflicts in the basin. It also has no mechanism for fostering basin level IWRM by way of getting the line agencies of the member countries to harmonize their water resources development programs.</p>",IW3,"<p>INDICATOR 1. Completion and adoption of the Strategic Action Program (SAP), with a framework, timeline and Financing Plan for implementation of priority activities. The SAP was endorsed by the Council of Ministers in June 2008, but the Investment Plan for SAP implementation was not developed within the duration of the project. A comprehensive Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA) was completed at national and regional levels. The TDA analysis was conducted through a participatory process and presents the transboundary problems as identified and prioritised by the basin stakeholders. The TDA identifies three overarching root causes of the transboundary problems caused by unsustainable resources use practices, i.e. (i) the absence of sustainable development on the political agendas of the riparian countries, (ii) low standards of environmental education and awareness, and (iii) population pressure. Based on the findings of the TDA, the SAP was completed as a regional policy framework for the Lake Chad Basin<br /><br />Based on the findings of the TDA, a Strategic Action Program (SAP) was completed as a regional policy framework for the Lake Chad Basin; the SAP was developed in a regional consultation process and endorsed by the Extraordinary COM in June 2008. This result is commendable as few Basins in Africa have been able to complete a SAP in five years. The SAP primarily addresses the seven priority regional environmental concerns as identified in the TDA, lays down the principles of environmental management and cooperation, and establishes a long-term vision for the sustainable development of the Lake Chad Basin. It subsequently defines a set of targets and interventions to meet regionally agreed Ecosystem Quality and Water Resource Objectives (EQWRO) and related indicators for the priority areas of environmental concern, in the transboundary context of the Lake Chad Basin. These EQWROs are: (i) improved quantity and quality of water; (ii) restoration, conservation and sustainable use of bio-resources; (iii) conservation of biodiversity; (iv) restoration and preservation of ecosystems; (v) strengthened participation and capacity of stakeholders, and (vi) institutional and legal frameworks for environmental stewardship of the LCB.<br />The overall objective of the SAP is to contribute to poverty alleviation in the Basin through priority actions, including (i) initiating shared management of the Basin‟s water resources, (ii) implementing a basin-wide sustainable data collection system (the LCB Observatory), (iii) taking sectoral actions for enhanced water demand management, (iv) fighting against desertification and against the loss of bio-diversity, (v) preventing and controlling pollution, and (vi) improving exploitation methods of aquatic ecosystems. The Project did not prepare the Action Program for the SAP implementation., Missing components include (i) estimated costs to achieve the identified EQWROs, (ii) an Investment Plan, and (iii) a strategy and financing mechanism. Although the envisaged donor conference could not yet be held, initial SAP implementation will to an extent be supported by the AfDB-funded LCB Sustainable Development Program (PRODEBALT).</p>",nap,,nap,,nav,,0,,0,,nav,,

It is unrealistic to expect that a country like Albania, with weak environmental support and understanding of the general population and many within the administration, will, within the limited period of a five-year project implementation period, accept and implement best practice of managed and protected nature reserves. As a result, project objectives must be set realistically with due regard to the time needed to change behavior and culture.<br />Lesson Two. The financial and implementation risks from projects with multiple financing sources cannot be emphasized enough. The IWEMP counted upon financing from the GEF and from the EIB, both of which have their special limitations and requirements as to preparation and implementation. When the risks of underfinanced investments materialized (as a result of the cost increases of the main construction contract) yet a third source, the EU IPA-financing, was brought in to finance critical connecting interceptors to bring wastewater to the WWTP. However, the IPA-funding came with its particular implementation conditions that might have contributed to further delays.<br />Lesson Three. The role of the World Bank as a convener of financing from several sources (GEF, EIB, and the EU/IPA) is risky since, without its own sizable financing, it is more difficult for the Bank to adjust the financing to changed needs. The decision of the World Bank not to extend the project closing date might have been prompted by the fact the GEF grant was fully committed by the closing date. Extending the Project closing date would have been hard to justify since the Bank would have used its own scarce operating budget to supervise investments financed by other financiers.<br />Lesson Four. The project name is Integrated Water and Ecosystems Management Project. Yet, the project failed to apply successfully the integrated nature of wastewater projects that require attention be paid to the (i) connection of buildings to the sewerage system; (ii) the collection of wastewaters to secondary sewers in the streets; (iii) the interception of the collected wastewater and conveyance to the wastewater treatment plants; and (iv) the safe and environmentally disposal of the treated effluents.<br />Lesson Five. It is risky to rely on a Private Operator to solve the many problems that face water supply and wastewater operations. Specifically, the employment of a private operator presumably meant that the Government was planning to rely on private management in the future which in turn means that the IWEMP expected the Management Operator to guarantee sustainable operations of the sewerage system and of the wastewater treatment plants. After the departure of the Management Operator the capacity to operate and maintain the project infrastructure is uncertain, endangering project sustainability.</p>",,,nav,,nap,,nap,,IWA,"<p>GEO Indicator 4 (IOI 5, and IOI 7): An Integrated Management Plan implemented for Kune Vain Managed Area.

The main conditions are the combination of control strategies, the intersectorial approach and community participation. The strategies needed for this kind of intervention, such as the control of mosquito breeding sites, cleaning houses and patios are easily adopted by the communities. They also contribute to the empowerment of the communities and to the change of the understanding about their participation in malaria control (Salinas V &amp; Narváez<br />A 2009).<br />Control of mosquito breeding sites and refugees are strategies that are easiest to adopt by the community, and it is a means for the communities to change their conception about malaria and the empowerment of malaria control activities. The personal education in every house in prior localities and the Situation Room are better strategies to educate, to involve and to empower the communities.<br />Malaria control requires a multi methodological approach with the combination of interventions related to: diagnosis and complete treatment (compliance), reservoir plasmodium elimination (active search for asymptomatic and febrile persons), control of mosquito breeding sites with physical and biological methods (larvae eating fish), control of mosquito refugees (clean house and clean yard), barrier mosquito-persons (Insecticide Impregnated Bed Nets).<br />Most malaria cases are located in specific towns and houses. That is why epidemiological stratification allows focusing the interventions in a few locations and makes the intervention more effective.<br />The design of a new demonstration project requires the development of a comprehensive protocol before the start of execution of: the systematization of experiences, impact assessment, cost effectiveness evaluation and surveillance, and monitoring system adapted to the strategy.<br />Relating to the elimination of DDT stockpiles, although PAHO has handled the component (including all difficulties) very well, a more experienced organization to conduct this type of highly specialized activity would have been more efficient. FAO is the UN entity with comparative advantage and experience in dealing with these specific activities. For future complex and multi country projects, the duration of the project should be six years, considering one year for the organization and institutional arrangements, four for implementation and one for evaluation and preparation of final reports.</p>",,"<p>Catalytic role was one of the key evaluation parameters with major success. It was rated as “highly satisfactory”; since there was an extension of the interventions to other neighbouring localities and municipalities due to an initiative of the community leaders and health workers. Only in México one locality had not replicated the model to other communities. In Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Honduras the replication was very extensive.

Too much effort was put into trying to formulate the SAP and this was in part due to the lack of knowledge of the FMMA requirements and administrative problems concerning the hiring of consultants without the approval of the responsible institutions of both governments.<br />4. Ninety percent of the demonstration projects of did not provide the expected elements of transference due to a lack of follow up by the executing agencies.<br />5. Local governments were not involved sufficiently in “demonstration projects” and this limited the necessary follow up.<br />6. There were long periods of ‘vacuum time’ (up to one year) for each change of government after presidential elections in both countries. This caused a slow process of involvement of new staff members responsible of the institutions in each country.<br />7.

It is also understood that there has been considerable progress in these aspects with the participation of both Ministries of Foreign Affairs and with MARENA and MINAE coordinating more than 221 institutions and organizations directly involved in the execution of these activities. These included representation of 97 federal government organizations, 29 NGOs, 22 private companies, 20 local governments and municipalities and 8 press and media organizations.

It defines most of what needs to be done in the area for the conservation of natural resources and for the reduction of the primary problems in the San Juan River Basin (SJRB). While this lacks the specifications of a project that can be directly implemented, this is not altogether inappropriate because such specifications are intended to be contained in the finalized SAP, due to be completed in early 2005. A Medium Sized GEF Project is to be proposed for activities in 2005-2007 (see Refs. 17 and 18) as an intermediate bridge to the next full GEF project phase. There are results and impacts of the current project, both within the information component and within the so-called “demonstration projects”, that have demonstrated, through experience, the possibilities of the two countries6 working together towards a common purpose. This is a very  important and major indirect benefit stemming from several of the project activities as distinct from their direct results and outputs.<br />An analysis of the TDA was completed as part of this evaluation with the conclusion that the TDA provides an excellent basis for the development of the strategic Action Programme. Previous work by the OAS played an important role in the development of the TDA. However, there were some limitations related to the information system used in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Data collection was fraught with difficulties to the point where the process was abandoned and then restarted. As a result, the most important analysis related to hydrology, and water resources and both countries suffered due to limited availability of data.</p>",nap,,nav,,nav,,0,,0,,nav,,

More than a hundred proposals were submitted for evaluation by a team of consultants under the supervision of UNEP-OAS and the Water Resources Secretariat. During several seminars organized in the main cities of the Alto Paraguay region, the proposals for constituent activities were presented. These proposals were presented with public participation by the potential activities coordinators. After the seminars, a team comprising the consultants, the UNEP-OAS, and the Water Resources Secretariat rated the proposals taking into consideration the proposed topic’s relevance to the GEF International Waters focal point. The activity selection methodology has merit because it includes a universe of stakeholders distributed throughout the entire Alto Paraguay region. It provided the necessary resources for research development on a multitude of critical issues in the region. This was an important lesson learned from the start. <br />(ii) A slightly smaller number of activities based on well-established institutions could have made the project more manageable, reduced the risk of delays and would have made it easier to focus in the main objective of the project. Such a reduction would have permitted concentration of the focus of the project on more demonstration pilot-activities. <br />(iii) Meetings with all sub-project coordinators were held periodically in order to provide technical, managerial and administrative orientation. The objectives of the technical coordination were to promote discussions on the objectives, methodology, intermediate products and the general coherence of each sub-project in order to assess the progress of all activities. This allowed for information exchange on their overall contribution to the broader project components and their contribution to the formulation of the Watershed Management Program for the Upper Paraguay Basin. This strongly contributed to the success of the project.<br />(iv) The technical coordination team, including the technical coordinator, sub-coordinator and a secretary, was subsequently relocated from Brasilia to Campo Grande, State of Mato Grosso do Sul, to facilitate communication and better support on-going activities. The performance of the project became far more effective as soon as the Technical Coordinator and his team started working in Campo Grande where most of the sub-projects took place.<br />(v) For a variety of reasons, the Technical Coordinator and his team was replaced twice during the duration of the project. Selecting and getting the new coordinator familiarized with the project and procedures resulted in periods of lower performance. The Technical Coordinator was selected by the Water Resources Secretariat and ANA staff. The current Technical Coordinator is very well prepared to efficiently and effectively manage the project to its conclusion.<br />(vi) A well-prepared manual to guide the coordinators in preparing standardised reports was formulated. Therefore, it has been learned that clear written rules are very important within the set of related activities of the project.<br />(vii) The project developed directives to standardise reporting formats. The use of this manual was of great value to the project and should be reproduced in other GEF projects. Congratulations to OAS Brasilian Office for the high quality of the project’s outputs.<br /><br />(i) Even though sub-projects such as environmental education have been useful in training teachers and are politically correct they could be more objective. In the context of these projects there are interesting themes and observations, but there are no real concrete results, since there is no guarantee that the teachers will incorporate the content of these projects in a systematic way in their classrooms. However, the enabling and training projects leave material in the libraries that serve as consultation material to other “multipliers”.<br />(ii) Another type of sub-project that is also politically correct is that which deals with the Indian (Native American). The Brasilian water resource law itself recommends attention be given to the Indian population. But, in the case of the GEF – Pantanal Project, a few difficulties appeared with the change of group leader, to the understanding of how to deal with indigenous communities. This seemed to be an area where FUNAI’s special expertise was evident when they participated towards the end of the subproject’s work.<br />(iii) The Sub-project (3.2) has been the only one out of the activities that had and performed some intensive on-site-activity. In this Sub-project, the team rehabilitated the physical environment, in Poconé (MT) by urbanising an area degraded by the mining. They have implemented advanced techniques of stabilising and protecting slopes that became e a valuable demonstration pilot project.<br />(iv) As a result of the GEF Project the fact that water contamination by mercury is limited to only to a few specific areas, and was not likely to be transported into transboundary areas, became better known.<br />(vi) The mechanism of silting on the lowlands has been studied in detail and it is known that over 16,9 million tons per year are retained in the Pantanal causing the expansion of the flooded areas.<br />(vii) The GEF Pantanal Project established that the capture of fish in the Taquari river has reduced by about 20% over the last 15 years and this is a relevant problem for the IBAMA to tackle.<br />(viii) The characterization and elaboration of an updated map of the two main “breaching” areas, Zé da Costa and Caronal, show that they extend together over 11.000 sq km, half as much the extension of the State of Sergipe and that they cause the permanent floods in the region of Paiaguás.<br /><br />(i)The activity selection methodology, due to its inclusiveness, highlighted a multitude of critical issues raised by stakeholders in the region, which means that the Project has focused on real problems;<br />(ii) A smaller number of Sub-Projects could have made the Project more manageable and easier to focus on the main objectives;<br />(iii) Dialogue was an outstanding permanent characteristic of the Project management. Meetings with all subproject coordinators were held periodically and this greatly contributed to the success of the Project; and;<br />(iv) A well-prepared manual to guide the coordinators in elaborating standardised reports was formulated and this facilitated communications and broader understanding of the full set of project activities.</p>","<p>1.

The National Water Resources Management System which was put in place provides for the establishment of policies, plans, and regulations for the control of water use and the preservation and restoration of water resources.<br />The project preparation phase was based on the assumption that the most effective way to actively involve main stakeholders in the project was to involve them directly in the formulation and execution of the project activities. To this end, three regional workshops were organized in the UPR basin and involved more than 200 people representing 60 institutions, while all demonstration projects and studies remained under the coordination of the institutions that originally presented them. For the execution of its activities, the project counted on consultancies that provided additional opportunities for stakeholder involvement, and a total of 116 public events took place, involving more than 4,530 participants and 258 organizations representing the federal, state, municipal and private sectors.<br />The public consultation process on the SAP process comprised 5 public events, with the participation of 563 stakeholders, and special effort was made to coordinate actions with already existing plans, programs, and initiatives in the basin.

Defining the subsidy level not only describes the cost-effectiveness of a project but also allows measuring the scale of necessary future intervention. In cases such as this one where it is obvious that the project will not sustain itself financially without state support, it is necessary to define the level of support needed.Possibly this level should be kept at a minimum to encourage farmers to engage their in contributions in kind - which seems to be prefered option, or in cash. It is crucial to provide society with a clear justification that public support is needed to obtain public benefit.<br />2. Politicization of project procedures should be minimized. There needs to be a detailed discussion on the form of the implementing agency for a given project. Should such an agency be necessary, a unit outside of the Ministry’s administrative constraints should be considered. That way, the PIU becomes a team of technical consultants rather than politically involved Ministry employees.<br />3. The project confirmed a deep necessity for the improvement of extension services in Poland. These services are seriously underdeveloped making progress of Polish agriculture questionable. It seems that the start of a discussion on modernizing extension services cannot take place without a sound discussion on development of funding mechanism of such activities.<br />4. Privately managed advisory firms are more effective than state ones. Similarly, the experience of LIT showed that team members independent of central institutions such as a Ministry perform their job better because they are not weighted by the administrative constraints of their home institutions.<br />5. Previous exposure to similar interventions influences project progress.<br />6. Flexibility of a demand-driven approach has a positive impact on project outcomes.<br />7. Convincing farmers about the necessity of certain technological solutions is possible through displaying a demonstration farm on the local scale. The farmer has to see that improvements are possible in his area, not in abstract places abroad. Such demonstrations awaken interest and hope that development is possible making the propagation of the idea a success. <br />8. It would be beneficial to encourage farmers to gather in groups to lower costs through joint tender procedures. Use of the tender procedure is the only way to assure cost-effectiveness of purchases for a project. The particularly low cost for construction of of manure tanks was due to the fact that the companies participating in the tender were trying to enter the market and made their offers really competitive, in some cases even below costs.<br />9. Gathering farmers into producers and equipment-using groups is financially beneficial to them. This proven concept needs to be supported with examples presented to the farmers as they are not easy to convince.<br />10. To assure sustainability, projects should consider designing a mechanism to transfer the experience of the project management into other body which may implement these projects.<br />11. Implementation of MIS. Development of project specific MIS requires allocation of significant resources. In the future, if possible, the system should be based on the existing systems allowing for flexible utilization and encompassing required and useful functions to avoid manual checks and additional<br />staff work during the project implementation.</p>","<p>1. Reduction in nutrient loads to local soil and water bodies in project area: Installation of manure management systems, including construction of manure platforms, adequate manure storage facilities and training in optimum application of manure as fertilizers as well as implementation of environmentally friendly agricultural practices such as shrub and tree planting led to a significant decrease in nutrient loads entering soil and water bodies from agricultural sources.  <br />2. Increased awareness of environmental issues among farmers: A broad public awareness program was undertaken to widen understanding of the importance of agriculture and environment among farmers in the project area which led to  a significant increase in the percentage of farmers  implementing environmentally friendly agricultural practices, including nutrient reduction measures.  The project trained agri-environmental advisors in good agricultural practices who subsequently worked with local farmers to demonstrate the benefits of environmentally responsible management on farms.

The sustainability of environmental projects depends on how much the public has learned about the environmental impact, and how much the attitude of beneficiaries towards environment has changed. Increasing the public’s knowledge is a relatively easy task compared to changing the attitudes of beneficiaries. Increasing knowledge or raising public awareness can be achieved through training sessions, documents distribution or media implication. Changing attitudes, on the other hand, is very hard. The rate of message adoption and behavioral change depend on the intrinsic value of the message, on the transmission medium, on the past experience of the subjects, and on their expectations. A systematic evaluation of the message adoption rate should be included in the environmental projects. This evaluation may help in selecting the best tools and media to transmit the message.<br />Capacity building. Capacity increase among the project beneficiaries depends strongly on their personal involvement in the project and on how attractive the project’s activities appear to them. One may expect a strong personal involvement in an activity that, for example, helps a person solve a similar problem in the future. For example, the Project trained hundreds of national technicians in data collection and report preparation. They have brought the acquired skills to the national levels. Virtually all information was collected nationally within the national services, using local human resources. These individuals probably still contribute to increased professionalism on the national environmental arena. It would be interesting to the UNDP and GEF to evaluate the impact of these agents on national and regional environmental activities.<br />Understanding transboundary pollution. Completing the Project’s activities advanced the national concerns about the basin-wide water pollution reduction problem. The increase in transboundary pollution understanding will become a lasting record since the Project transformed an abstract concept of a transboundary pollution into a neat package of identified problems. The identified polluting agents have a clear and measurable consequence of pollution. The Project strengthened, as well, personal collaboration among the high-ranking officials of the various ministries. It is, therefore, possible to put a human face on an anonymous governmental decision. Putting a recognizable features onto the vague problem of transboundary water pollution, the Project made this issue<br />more comprehensive than any before in the history of such regional collaboration.</p>","<p>• A Transboundary Analysis was carried out through the updating of National Reviews to obtain a complete knowledge base for priority pollution loads and environmental issues in the DRB. <br />• A Strategic Action Program was developed and accepted, and implementation begun through the Strategic Action Program Implementation Programme. <br />• A review of Monitoring, Laboratory and Information Management (MLIM) practices was conducted to assess needs (systems, equipment, training) to provide required environmental information.<br />• A Danube Accident and Emergency Warning System (AEWS) was established to adopt a common surveying and monitoring procedure throughout the region.<br />• A series of diagnostic missions was carried out in 17 tributary catchments of the DRB.

Most arise out of roles and responsibilities, processes and procedures, and governance.<br />Following on its early difficulties, the project strived to carry out all the planned activities and achieve its targeted Outcomes. While the budget appeared adequate, the timescale of three years was overly optimistic. It would seem that the time allowed for stakeholder engagement in GEF projects is often too short.<br />The lack of clarity in the respective roles of IA and EA was a critical factor in the difficulties faced by this project. The lesson is that UNDP may need to re-consider its policy of engaging an agency that is also a GEF IA, as the EA for its regional projects,.<br />Another factor which created difficulties for the project was the low level of engagement by UNDP COs and in spite of the high level of engagement by the UNDP/RTA, UNDP may need to review its approach to regional projects and the role and function of COs in regional projects. This may need to be framed within the availability of IA resources that UNDP receives as a GEF Implementing Agency.<br />The purpose of Indicators is often misunderstood and rather than serving as an effective tool for assessing project progress, they become a useless, but time consuming exercise at project formulation and are then impossible to reconcile at project implementation. Guidance is required on setting and using Indicators so as to ensure their usefulness.<br />The timing of TEs needs to be reconsidered. It would probably be most effective if it is carried out soon after the final PIR is available.<br />The importance of a robust Exit Strategy and Sustainability Plan cannot be over-stated and there is a need for guidance on what is exactly required. In particular, a project must identify a champion and nurture it/him/her so the project legacy can be passed on.<br />Co-funding needs to be taken more seriously and the GEF rules and procedures surrounding cofunding must be rationalized. If in-kind contributions by government are to be accepted as cofunding they must be based on reality and must then be accounted for. If it is simply to satisfy some bureaucratic requirement at project formulation and approval, then it should not be raised to a higher level of importance than it deserves, e.g. in the PIRs.<br />The LogFrame or Strategic Results Framework needs to be reviewed annually, as part of the PIR exercise, and the process should extend into considerations of adaptive management, this then to be reflected in the AWP.<br />IW foundational projects depend on a clear understanding of the TDA/SAP process by all key stakeholders. This must be established at the beginning of the project so as to clarify the relationship between the TDA and the SAP. The MTE recommendation of a workshop on GEF, the TDA/SAP process and related matters has merit.<br />Although it is a tenet of GEF policy that Implementing Agencies apply their own procedures to Terminal Evaluations, there is a need to reconsider the appropriateness of an EA issuing contracts for the evaluation of its own performance – the independence of the evaluators and the quality of the evaluation could be jeopardized by this practice.</p>",,,IW3,<p>National inter-ministerial/ inter-sectoral committees (NICs) were established in all three countries in the last reporting period.

The at-times limited availability of GEFSEC to respond to questions of clarification following the reorientation of the project was a source of frustration for the Secretariat and partners.<br /><br />A lesson of relevance for all GEF projects that are designed directly to respond to internal strategic or ‘corporate’ needs identified by the GEF Council, is to ensure the necessary resources for GEFSEC participation at all stages in the project development as well as in strategic meetings such as, but not limited<br />to, the project inception meeting and Steering Committee meetings. This is a relatively low-cost approach which would help avert any need for (potentially costly) reorientation of projects where the client needs are very specific.</p>",,"<p>The intended catalytic role of the TWAP, and its contribution to the GEF4 IW Strategic objective to catalyze transboundary action addressing water concerns, was reflected in the project rationale, namely that the results of a robust, science based assessment of the status of international waters will convince policy makers and investors to undertake the necessary actions to address the multiple and complex human induced stresses that<br />are degrading transboundary water systems. The extended results chain towards this outcome is described in the ROtI analysis.<br /><br />At this stage, the incentives put in place to catalyze behavioural change are at the level of the assessment partnership which has been largely defined. The MSP has established a foundation for future collaboration amongst the technical partners within each group, amongst the lead partners, and between the lead partners and UNEP. This built on existing relationships but also forged new relationships in a context where appreciation of the respective partners’ roles was, at times, affected by inter-institutional politics. <br /><br /><br />In terms of institutional changes, the project has enabled partner organizations to consider how best they may be able to increase their assessment capabilities and value of ongoing assessment work over the short term, with implementation of a first assessment, and over the longer term through influencing the way in which they collect, compile and/or present data to users. The interest of UNESCO IOC in expanding the thematic scope of the global ocean observing system (GOOS) is a good example of how the project has influenced and has the potential to influence the practices of partner organizations towards eventual mainstreaming of the assessment.<br /><br />The MSP has not yet contributed to external policy changes but the transboundary waters assessment during the FSP is expected to do so, as described in the ROtI analysis and project rationale. <br /><br />The project has not yet contributed directly to sustained follow-on financing (catalytic financing) from Government or other donors though it has already established an important commitment in terms of in-kind support and some direct funding for a first assessment.<br /><br />The GEFSEC has been an important champion for the MSP, both as client and also in providing a vision in terms of the strategic importance of the planned assessment for GEF and other organizations. The project has also created opportunities for individual experts to influence the development of the methods and bring in new and emerging ideas on issues such as cumulative impacts and governance.</p>",nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,-1,,-1,,nav,,

The NCAPs have done much to raise the profile of CEP in the countries and improve the understanding of the importance of working together to tackle larger transboundary problems. The NCAPs improved to a great extent Intersectoral coordination and increased environmental investments in the Caspian littoral countries. By starting with the NCAPs and building to a SAP, instead of vice versa, substantial country ownership was gained.<br /><br />2) Strengthening NGOs and civil society is a major challenge requiring significant resources.  It can also be an overly vague goal in the absence of specific targets. If projects are to attempt civil society strengthening, they must have very clear and realistic targets.<br /><br />3) Individual small grant projects require significant managerial support, technical support and oversight. They also require clear objectives and “mini” logical frameworks. Ensure this is all included in the project design.</p>","<p>1. A Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA), Strategic Action Programme (SAP), and National Caspian Action Programs (NCAPs) were all successfully developed.<br /><br />2.

The Convention serves as an overarching legal framework governing cooperation on Caspian environmental and sustainable bioresources management, while binding agreements on specific problems are governed by implementing protocols.

Each country had delivered the first drafts of the NCAPs to national fora for close scrutiny by other ministries, NGOs, and members of the public.  Each NCAP reflects the issues highlighted in the TDA, and the interventions suggested towards achieving the Environmental Quality Objectives (EQOs).  The issues highlighted are comparable between the NCAPs; therefore each country recognises the same national and transboundary issues facing the sustainable management of the Caspian Sea.</p>",IW3,"<p>Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis - The TDA was achieved through strong regional input and in a very participatory manner, involving experts from around the region and internationally, in four regional meetings held between July 2000 and November 2001. Caspian Regional Thematic Centres were responsible for generating (through data collection and some limited research) the considerable amount of information within the TDA.  It was made available on the CEP website in Russian and English. Through the TDA process, CEP has improved transparency by enabling data to be shared more freely and willingly.</p>",IW3,"<p>2003 SAP - Strategic Action Programme - The SAP was in the early stages of its development by the end of Phase I. Having set out the issues relating to the sustainable use of the Caspian Sea in the TDA, together with EQOs, the SAP provides continuity to the process by presenting a road map for future policy, legislation, regulatory and investment interventions relating to the management of the environment. It is a synthesis of the major transboundary issues identified in the NCAPs and includes both baseline and incremental interventions.

Research carried out by the Project indicates that coral reefs, as we know them, will not likely survive the rapid increases in global temperatures and atmospheric CO2 that are forecast this century, and coral reefs around the world are still in such serious decline that they put at risk the environmental and economic stability of many coastal nations.  The results of the research were published in a 2007 paper in the journal Science; the paper was extremely influential in informing the international debate on ecological tipping points and safe targets for CO2 concentrations surrounding negotiations for a UNFCCC post-Kyoto Protocol in Copenhagen and beyond. The paper was cited in the scientific literature over 400 times, and in the Bank’s WDR 2010 on Climate Change and in UN reports as well as in calls for setting 350 ppm as the target for a safe limit to atmospheric CO2 concentrations. <br /><br />2.  The Project has created a number of research breakthroughs with the information instrumental in improving management strategies for coral reefs to adapt to changes in the environment and developing management priorities that are most appropriate for their future.  These include: (i) software for monitoring the health of coral reefs; (ii) methods to detect changes in coastal environments;    (iii) application of remote sensing to the management of biodiversity; (iv) the creation of an Ocean Atlas and Global Atlas to manage coral bleaching and disease; (v) models and tools to predict the impact of coastal developments and climate change on coral reefs; (vi)  results of  reef restoration  trials including valuable information on substrates to be used for outplanting, the value of natural versus artificial recruitment, the importance of water velocity, the survival of transplants on natural versus artificial coral, and obstacles to artificial rearing of corals (e.g. fish browsing), and; (vii) the establishment of an important baseline for exploring the major responses of corals to environmental pressures arising from climate change, for example background temperature, light conditions and water current. <br /><br />3.  Key policy or management changes have been made including: (i)  Under the Local Government Initiative,  the Project engaged with approximately 13 local governments or municipal councils plus  numerous government departments and local stakeholders over four regions.  Examples of results include:<br />Philippines:  working with mayors and LGUs in the Philippines to identify cost-effective business practices to relieve pressure on reefs and adopt MPA  Enforcement Protocol Guidelines for law enforcement to help enforcers with LGUs discharge their duties and functions more effectively.  The project involved six LGUs (Municipality of Bolinao, Municipality of Bani, Municipality of Agno, Municipality of Dasol, Municipality of Burgos and Municipality of Masinloc); three government agencies (Dept of Environment and Natural Resources (Pangasinan), Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (Region 1) and Office of the Provincial Agriculturalist (Pangasinan); six  local organisations; three media outlets and; four academic institutions.  Agreement was made amongst the mayors to collaborate on coastal resource management issues with local executives, policy makers and key stakeholders apprising each other of developments in coastal resource management in their areas.<br /><br />Mexico:  Worked  with municipal-level officials, urban development agencies, state urban development and environment agencies and federal agencies for tourism, the environment (with a focus on the national protected areas commission and the environmental enforcement agency, PROFEPA) to influence better decision making for sustainable development and resource use in the region.   Developed a basic guidebook of the legal framework for the region and partnered with the Mexican Center for Environmental Law to finalize a general informative publication, and served as a liaison with enforcement agencies at each governance level.  Additional tools included sharing information on the legal framework, specific laws and regulations and the ongoing findings from the CRTR that could potentially inform regulations and legislative processes related to coral reef impact issues, marine turtle conservation, mangrove protection, and zoning criteria along the coast (i.e. potential impact from golf courses; habitat loss through mangrove destruction; water contamination due to inadequate waste water treatment systems, overuse of coral reefs from aquatic tourism).<br />(ii) In Mexico, engagement with municipal governments and the tourism industry on the damage to reefs from <br />contaminated groundwater as a result of accelerated coastal development has informed public debate on the <br />limits to tourism growth in the most tourism intensive area of Mexico, and temporarily canceled two-large scale <br />development projects threatening the Puerto Morelos reefs, and; <br />(iii) in Belize, direct policy and management implications from the Project has provided a compelling report to <br />the Government on the drastic decline of parrotfish and corresponding rise in macroalgae.

The project was well-conceived yet poorly designed; participatory in their nature yet prone to concentrate the means in the PCU. The answer to this question is beyond the scope of the present evaluation; we do not have at our disposal all the elements needed to formulate the whole answer. Yet, before the next step in assisting the region in Black Sea protection, the Implementing Agency, the Executing Agency and Istanbul Commission have a strong interest in achieving deeper understanding of the years of the project's execution. The analysis itself will increase coherence of the regional co-operation programs and will help to re-design the &quot;umbrella&quot; for the next generation of regional projects.<br />When the first RER/93/G31 project was initiated, all parties were eager for regional co-operation. The countries adopted the Odessa Declaration, designated the Activity Centers and national focal points, and detached national administrators to co-ordinate project activities within the countries. Both projects financed training programs, workshops and research. They drafted regional and national SAPs and TDA, organized NGOs and sensitized citizens. Seven years later, the urgency has gone or perhaps has not been perceived symmetrically. The regional SAP deadlines were not respected, and the national SAPs are not yet approved. Regional co-operation in Istanbul is not yet fully implemented, and Activity Centers are without funding for regional activities.<br />The massive absence of concern for the Black Sea environment reflects to some extent the fragility of the concept of Black Sea environment protection as it was formulated in the SAP and national environmental programs.<br />Clearly, no scientific arguments alone can overcome ambivalence of the governments: between the will to restore the profitability of the Black Sea and the reluctance to invest; between necessity to co-operate and temptation to return to past, traditional isolation; between the necessity to act for the benefit of other countries and a desire to free-ride on their efforts. Government actions must be motivated by national interests: whereas the projects concentrated themselves on scientific or intellectual justification of Black Sea protection. The future efforts should probably be directed toward development of credible economic arguments and workable political pressures.</p>",<p>[see 2263]</p>,<p>[see 2263]</p>,nav,,IW2,,IW3,,nav,,IW2,<p>• A Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis was prepared.</p>,IW3,"<p>• A total of 88 national and regional thematic assessments were produced, fueling the preparation of the Black Sea Strategic Action Program.<br />• A Black Sea Strategic Action Program was developed and signed by the ministers of the environment of the six Black Sea countries.<br />• A portfolio of urgent priority investments was identified and six pre-feasibility studies were implemented.</p>",nap,,IW1,,nav,,0,,0,,nav,,<p>• Black Sea technical and advisory networks were established in the thematic areas of emergency response; pollution monitoring; biodiversity; integrated coastal zone management and fisheries.

One of the main outcomes of the Project is the establishment of the institutional mechanism to coordinate the activities of the four countries in the management of Guarani Aquifer System (GAS) that did not exist before the Project. The Project also extended this new culture of cooperation among specialists, universities and institutions in the four countries.<br />2. Technical and scientific studies conducted through the Project concluded that lateral movement of groundwater in the GAS is very slow and impacts from over pumping and pollution are highly localized. Therefore, management of the aquifer is essentially a local set of activities. The four countries now have a good understanding and feel much more confident to develop and manage the aquifer individually without worrying about wide-ranging regional/transboundary impacts. It would have been very difficult to get to this point and to have this shared understanding without having a regional project.<br />3. As a preventive project, the key performance indicators basically targeted the reduction of future risks:<br />(i)    pollution risks diminished or controlled;<br />(ii)   overdraft risks diminished or stabilized;<br />(iii)  future inter-country groundwater conflicts risk diminished; and<br />(iv)  future mitigation and stabilization costs reduced.</p>",,nav,,IW3,<p>May 2003.

The financial investment mechanism established at the two demonstration sites promote public sector-private sector partnership and is replicable elsewhere. The use of ICM demonstration sites as “laboratory” for coastal management should be replicated in all countries of the region. The model legislation on “Framework for national legislation for marine pollution” is a useful tool for countries wishing to improve their legislative framework to improve environmental management.</p>",nav,,nav,,IW3,<p>PEMSEA</p>,nav,,nav,,IWA,<p>Sustainable Development Strategy 2003</p>,nav,,nav,,nav,,0,,0,,nav,,

Given the longer-term program for management of Lake Victoria, these lessons are particularly relevant. As is fitting for a project supporting acquisition of knowledge, many of the lessons learned are<br />technical in nature. Among the most important that were not known at the outset of the project are the following:<br />- l Biodiversity of fish has declined, but many species thought to be extinct in the watershed are in fact present in refugia in satellite lakes.<br />- A sustainable catch of Nile Perch is probably within the range of 220,000 tons annually (trawl surveys) to 350,000 tons annually (acoustic survey).<br />- Point sources of pollution are important locally and have effects on public health, but are not the largest sources of phosphorus and nitrogen exacerbating eutrophication of the lake.<br />- Eutrophication is primarily due to nitrogen and phosphorus from atmospheric deposition, although therelative contribution of the catchment to it is yet unknown.<br />- The lake level has varied significantly over time and is highly sensitive to small changes in the balanceof inflows and outflows.<br />- Constructed wetlands can be effective measures to enhance the contribution that natural wetlands make toward water quality.<br />- Water hyacinth can be effectively contained in the lake through biological control (weevils), but weevils are less effective in the rivers that flow into the lake.<br /><br />Interlinked national projects are vulnerable to failure of one of the partners, and must build in peer review and assistance, and safeguards in the event that these fail.<br />The inability to extend the IDA credit in Kenya was a serious problem for both of the other projects and for the regional effort overall. Partners should agree at the design phase to be mutually accountable for performance and mutually supportive when problems arise, so that they can be spotted and remedied early.<br />Scientific research must be targeted, provide usable information for management decisions and be widely accessible.<br />Given the resource constraints and urgency of the need better to manage the lake, the monitoring and research undertaken should be targeted, applied, and framed with cognizance of the necessary and sufficient levels of information needed for management. The research should be managed efficiently,<br />bringing in innovative mechanisms such as competitive grants, and subject to peer review for quality control. Outputs from monitoring and research should be widely shared. Regional projects necessitate greater emphasis on clarity of project objectives, monitorable frameworks, at multiple levels, and adequate mechanisms for governance<br /><br />Given weaknesses in capacity, clear objectives, indicators and targets help focus efforts towards results. Coordination and sharing of information are important, but real improvement in the state of the lake will require a mutually agreed set of standards linked to recognized indicators and enforced through agreed<br />mechanisms including both incentives and sanctions. Establishment of such mechanisms is the core agenda of the second phase, drawing on knowledge created during the first and the initial experience with creation of institutions for governance. For instance, the weak motivation for prioritizing waste water treatment<br />pilots resulted from lack of regulations and/or enforcement.<br /><br />The Basin perspective is critical to address the key environmental issues of Lake Victoria<br /><br />The initial focus of the program was on the lake itself, particularly on fisheries (with 41 percent of allocated resources). The key scientific results underscore the importance of interventions at the basin level in order to address the problems of the lake. For instance, the important finding resulting from water<br />quality monitoring indicates that atmospheric deposition accounts for the bulk of pollution in the lake (and part of the deposition may originate outside the basin). Similarly, some water hyacinth originates upstream from the riparian countries (in Rwanda and Burundi).<br />Capacity Building has to address both current and projected gaps.<br /><br />The project started with varying capacities among the three countries necessitating a careful strategy for need-based and gap-filling capacity building at all relevant institutions (not just research bodies). While the project upgraded skills and equipped institutions it did not project needs and address future gaps (there were long employment freezes in these countries with implications for capacity resulting from generational transitions). The timeline and intensity of capacity building has to be better managed to avoid lack of personnel to implement and scale-up.<br />Implementation in the future can be undertaken through governmental structures. The project relied on contracted staff and stand-alone PMUs for implementation. This was probably necessary at the time, but opened the door for insularity, some institutional jealousy regarding pay scales,<br />and adverse incentives (e.g., high costs for workshops and travel allowances). Moreover, in Kenya even contracted staff did not perform well in all cases, so the objective of the contracting was not met. Mainstreaming of implementation within governmental structures is now feasible and is a better approach<br />for the future. Environmental benefits must be strongly linked to improved livelihoods for local people and<br />communities. Community based micro-projects were highly successful and helped provide low-cost services on health, education, livelihoods related needs. They served as vehicles for raising awareness and capacity on sustainable land management, public health and sanitation, gender, and HIV/AIDS. The BMUs, CBOs, CIGs and other community institutions helped empower local decision-making and lead to an increase in livelihood opportunities. This approach was found useful in building community buy-in for activities generating positive environmental externalities pertinent to the Lake’s health. There is need for further<br />attention to public health aspects (sanitation and HIV/AIDS), micro-credit access and the socio-economic impacts of increasing migration to the lakeshore.<br />Good education of the public and parliamentarians is critical for long term sustainability and success. Proper management of Lake Victoria will require a long term commitment of public funds and willingness of people living in the basin to change behaviors. Attainment of both requires relentless and sophisticated<br />investment in public education.</p>","<p>1. This project, including Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, was the first of its kind in the region, and supported many knowledge-building activities that advanced the understanding of the Lake Ecosystem,  particularly in the areas of biodiversity of fish (establishing a baseline), levels and sources of pollution, fish stocks, and hydrology.<br />2.  Regional planning and implementation a great success.  The LVFO (Lake Victoria Fisheries Organization) was operationalized, fisheries sector frameworks were harmonized, regional information  exchange was strengthened and the East African Community (EAC) was re-established<br />3.  Significant work of the fish quality lab resulted in lifting of the temporary European Union (EU) markets' ban on import of fish from the lake.</p>",,nav,,IWA,"<p>INDICATOR  2.  Harmonization among the three countries legislation addressing management of fisheries and environment variables important in the lake basin, and improved enforcement of this legislation.<br />Notable success in harmonizing the fisheries legislation and regulatory frameworks among the three countries and enforcement of the fisheries legislation  was initiated  in all countries. The LVFO  was established to play a crucial role in the implementation and enforcement of the legislations in the fisheries sector. Thr project also supported the development of co-management institutions or Beach Management Units (BMUs) and this institutional change helped improve the effectiveness of fisheries extension and strengthen fish quality assurance.</p>",IW3,"<p>INDICATOR 1. Establishment of the Lake Victoria Fisheries Organization (LVFO)<br />The project resulted in the LVFO being active and coordinating regional activities. <br /><br />The three countries made considerable progress in advancing the regional perspective in both planning and implementation. The Lake Victoria Fisheries Organization was operationalized, although it requires strengthening. Fisheries sector frameworks were harmonized and regional information exchange was strengthened. During the course of implementation of the project, the East African Community (EAC) was re-established and recognized coordination of activities in Lake Victoria as among its priorities. Although the role of the EAC was not foreseen during preparation of the project and required some adjustment in understanding of responsibilities, it has been an important breakthrough in facilitating shared management. The EAC passed the Lake Victoria Protocol and, with its ratification by member states in November 2004, created the Lake Victoria Basin Commission (LVBC) based in Kisumu. A common Lake Victoria vision<br />was developed by the partner states with extensive consultation at the community level. Through the EAC and LVBC it is expected that the riparian states will be in a strong position in the future to act on the enhanced knowledge about the lake by agreeing on common enforcement of standards and regulations, some of which are now on the books but unevenly enforced.<br /><br />The national secretariat was under the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources and Wildlife, and reported to the Permanent Secretary of the ministry. The office was originally in Nairobi at the ministry headquarters, but moved to Kisumu in 2001/02 to be nearer the project operations, partly staffed by seconded ministerial staff and contract staff. Although systemic issues were a key factor in the delays in flow of funds, the secretariat's was unable effectively to address the problem. Long and continued dissatisfaction with the Secretariat’s performance resulted in the termination of the National Executive Secretary’s contract in May 2002. A new Secretary was appointed who remained until the end of 2002, when the whole Secretariat was dismissed due to heightened dissatisfaction with observed performance. Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) was then made the implementing agency in recognition of KARI's past success in implementation of projects and due to the need to find an agency able to implement the GEF financed activities that had to continue in Kenya for the regional effort to succeed. The transition was far from smooth and the new secretariat was only able to come on board in late 2003. This secretariat functioned strictly in a coordinating role and left implementation to the components. The components did appreciate the facilitative role of the coordinator in Kisumu, and KARI supported an increased pace of implementation compared to the earlier period. Nevertheless, implementation continued to be constrained by new problems with flows of funds. A detailed audit of financial management after the shift of responsibility for implementation to KARI revealed problems of commingling of project funds, resulting in some financing of LVEMP activities out of other sources, and use of LVEMP funds for other activities. Delays in flow of funds even after the transfer of implementing responsibility constrained activity within the components, and reduced overall effectiveness.</p>",nav,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,-1,,-1,,nap,,"<p>Much of the activity in the project was oriented towards capacity building. Important experience was gained in scientific research and resource management, while technical skills were upgraded and the implementing institutions were equipped. Staff were trained to advanced degree courses (M.Sc. and Ph.D.) and others received on-the-job and short courses training. Capacity building and awareness raising campaigns targeted local communities through a variety of instruments (use of local media, training days, workshops, study tours etc.) Capacity building efforts were uncoordinated and opportunistic, rather than based on a well-defined strategy addressing identified needs. Future efforts should be better targeted and impacts of capacity building should be assessed.</p>"

It is of paramount importance to have a clear logical framework. This will include:<br /> A clear overall objective and project goal;<br /> A manageable number of SMART indicators, at least at the objective and outcome levels;<br /> A sharp focus on impacts/outcomes or results. This should be in terms of changed practices, changed behaviour and/or changed situations;<br /> Clarity and simplicity so all stakeholders can understand the project‘s goals and aims.<br />2. Strengthening NGOs and civil society is a major challenge requiring significant resources. It can also be an overly vague goal in the absence of specific targets. If projects of this nature are to attempt civil society strengthening, they must have very clear and realistic targets. This should not be an add-on or a secondary aim.<br />3. Awareness raising is an important aspect of many projects’ work. A challenging, resource-intensive task, it is not an objective that can be added-on easily. It is important to clarify the specific targets – in terms of stakeholder groups and improved knowledge or changed behaviour, not in terms of documents produced. It is also important to ensure the right expertise is mobilised.<br />4. Project design should be adapted to the dynamic environment where government staff turnover is high. Indeed, this project may have some good practices to share in this regard.<br />5. GEF regional projects cannot make major region-wide investments, not even in data collection. They can only be catalytic. Hence, do not expect regional projects to directly undertake significant groundwork, but expect them to influence, catalyse and leverage.<br />6. Small grants programmes should be designed to clearly contribute to overall project objectives and the question should be asked, “Are small grants projects are the most efficient way to achieve objectives?”<br />7. Individual small grant projects require significant managerial support, technical support and oversight. They also require clear objectives and ―mini‖ logical frameworks. Ensure this is all included in the project design.<br />8. Inter-governmental coordination and cooperation and convention processes are complex. Expectations should be appropriate. Project should not be burdened with too many ambitious tasks. They should focus on clear and catalytic roles.<br />9. To achieve sustainability of the project-inspired outcomes, the project design needs to include a focus on sustainability. Care and attention should be given to defining just what sustainability means and what specific activities and functions are targeting sustainability.<br />10. Projects should upgrade a logical framework that is not working well. This is best done at inception or in the first year, through a well-documented, transparent process.<br />11. Ensure there are regular (annual and mid-term) learning and reflection management exercises for the project staff and the Steering Committee. These reflections should discuss project strengths and challenges. For example, the PIR process should be adapted into an annual monitoring and management exercise that links workplans to indicators. The mid-term review should be an integral part of project learning and planning. Outside facilitation to these would be beneficial.<br />12. Keep the contents of the PIR constant and/or document any changes clearly.<br />13. Maintain a documented record of the impact and changes brought about by the project. Projects like this should, as a matter of priority, document the actions taken by stakeholders in response to project work or as a result of the project‘s work.<br />14. Typically, during the first phase, national ownership will have been generated. This must be considered a starting point, and must be consolidated during the second phase. Steps must be in place to further build ownership during the second phase with specific targets that define what “ownership” means and to monitor this consolidation.<br />15. The balance between ‗continuing the actions of the first phase‘ and ‗rejuvenating and transforming the project approach‘ is an important one. Phase 2 must maintain the gains from Phase 1, but not simply be a continuation of Phase 1.<br />16. Take care to avoid a supply-driven nature to the project design and implementation. At the end of the first phase, the required activities may appear obvious, and the required inputs ‗standing by‘. However, it is necessary to strategize, go back to basic planning, and ensure the activities are geared towards the needs and objectives, or to addressing the threats and root causes.<br />17. In regional projects it is important to pay attention to specific economic trends and factors in each country that could affect staff and expert recruitment. In this case, ―one size does not fit all‖ when it comes to salary requirements of qualified experts across the five countries.<br />18. Health and Safety Considerations. One MSG project involved incinerating POPs in a small-scale, local incinerator. These kinds of ―on-the-ground‖ funding programs should include consideration of health and safety issues among their criteria.<br />19. The design of any future intervention should be carefully adapted to present context, conditions and needs. Hold a strategic reflection on how best to utilise available international support in the future. What are the aims of CEP/emerging TC Secretariat, how to get there, who should do what?<br />20. Consolidate the documented record of project impact, including:<br /> What changes the project has catalyzed in each country in terms of laws, policies, budgetary allocations, institutional and individual knowledge, institutional arrangements, and research and environmental management practices. This will serve as a valuable baseline for any additional efforts in the region;<br /> The main lessons learned from this project. Utilize sufficient project resources to capture these. What has worked well and not so well and why;<br /> Encourage each country unit of the project (National Focal Point, SAPIC, RAG leaders) to document the country-specific policy and institutional barriers (and as a result, opportunities) to improved environmental management and monitoring. Each country has learned a great deal about their own institutions and policies as a result of their participation in the Project. This needs to be considered and captured on paper to enable effective next steps.<br /> Conduct an assessment of the effectiveness of the MSGP. This would give the project a much better idea of the kinds of tangible impacts the program produced.<br />21. It is noted that it proved far easier to register large investments into NCAP related activities than to mobilise small funding to regional cooperation and coordination actions. The reasons for this are not fully clear, and further analysis is recommended.<br />22. Look to the ABC for lessons learned (positive and negative) regarding sustainability of a mechanism for regional cooperation.<br />23. Resolve the location of the TC Secretariat – one possibility would be to have a TC Secretariat with several centres of expertise established for key areas of focus in each of the other countries. The most obvious and practical place for the Secretariat is Baku, which is located in the middle north-to-south and the only capital on the Caspian, with air travel connections to each of the other four countries. PCU can facilitate discussions.<br />24. There is a likelihood that any future GEF support will include a strong focus on the Fisheries sector. Fisheries is a major issue in the Caspian and it is one of the most difficult issues. Any fisheries effort must be driven by the fisheries sector, and must have the full support and backing of all Caspian countries, particularly Russia, with the largest fishing fleet in the Caspian. Undertake stakeholder analysis and generate stakeholder buy-in. For example, in order to facilitate cooperation on fisheries, the Aquatic Bioresources Commission of the Caspian Sea (ABC) has a clear mandate and is a key stakeholder. Any CEP-SAP action in fisheries should be preceded by a political effort to link the CEP-SAP with the ABC work programme.<br />25. Conduct an evaluation of the overall Caspian Environment Programme (CEP). This project is but one component within the overall CEP. Country governments and partner international institutions should consider an evaluation of the larger CEP, particularly since the insights and lessons generated from such an evaluation could be very beneficial to the nascent Tehran Convention process.<br />26. It is unrealistic to expect a regional process to reach sustainability in such a short time. The process has taken important steps forward, but has not yet reached sustainability. International support to this process is still critical. For example, this would facilitate the determination of the Secretariat location, mobilize resources to the Secretariat‘s mid-term budget and support the process to sign and ratify protocols. However, a proper exit strategy for international support is essential, with good indicators and milestones of progress towards sustainability.<br />27. Be careful to maintain conceptual integrity individual investments/projects, when part of a larger programme. At times, the lines between the CEP-SAP project and the CEP (programme) seem to have been blurred. This is helpful and unhelpful: helpful because it means the stakeholders do not distinguish between CEP-I and CEP-II (CEP-SAP) and see only a continuous programme. It is unhelpful because it has perhaps contributed to the CEP-SAP losing some project-specific focus.<br />28. Subsequent to the ratification of the TC, the Convention now has the force of legal obligation in each country. This is an excellent basis for strengthening sustainability. Future international support should focus on empowering countries to take responsibility for specific actions in line with the TC.<br />29. To increase country driven-ness, future investment should consider giving more thought to balancing the regional role of international funders with creating strong incentives for robust national action and national support for transboundary coordination.</p>",,,nav,,IW4,"<p>Examples of the Project‘s strengths include the achievements under Objective 3, mainly, the ratification by all 5 Caspian Countries of the Tehran Convention and the development of draft protocols to the Convention, which if ratified by the countries, will pave the way for more significant national-level commitment.<br /><br />The Tehran Convention - The Tehran Convention was signed on 04 November 2003 and 90 days after the submission of the instrument of ratification by the fifth Contracting Party entered into force on 12 August, 2006.</p>",IW2,<p>Teheran Convention Secretariat</p>,nav,,IW4,,IW4,"<p>Strategic Action Programme – The objective in Phase II was to commence implementation of the SAP in the priority areas of Biodiversity, Invasive Species and Persistent Toxic Substances.

With international support (e.g. from the EU, the Darwin Initiative, NATO, etc), the countries in the region were participating in a range of projects to monitor and to improve the environmental situation and to implement certain elements of the SAP. These projects would have continued without GEF support under the second phase. Generally, given slowly growing environmental awareness and increased government revenue, the countries in the region were likely to increase the level of some SAP-related environmental investments through the baseline period, for example in waste water treatment, pollution abatement, protected area systems and monitoring. These investments mostly would have been implemented without cooperation among the countries.

A comprehensive Transboundary Diagnosis Analysis (TDA) and a Strategic Action Program (SAP) were completed following a participatory process that included multidisciplinary teams at the national and regional level. The TDA analysis conducted during the project preparation in the main stem countries was completed in 2009 and validated through a participatory process. It presented the transboundary problems as identified and prioritized by the basin stakeholders, with high and medium priorities assigned to respectively (i) land degradation (degradation of vegetation cover and soil erosion), (ii) water resources degradation (reduced water availability and quality), and (iii) loss of terrestrial biological diversity. Following the conclusions of the TDA, the SAP is a policy document that: (i) complemented the  Niger Basin  Sustainable  Development  Action  Plan (SDAP), (ii) identified future sustainable development investments in the Basin, (iii) ranked trans-boundary environmental problems, (iv) provided information on specific sites on the Basin that have a rich biodiversity, (v) identified political, legal and institutional reforms, and (v) integrated aspects related to climate change/variability <br />emphasizing their transversal character and socio-economic impacts. The SAP also provided a first estimate of the cost of addressing the transboundary environmental aspects that were not yet included in the SDAP and estimated the cost to be about US$1.5 billion. The SAP was endorsed at the appropriate <br />political level (the Council of Ministers) in November 2010 and it covers the period 2013 – 2027, parallel to subsequent SDAP phases.</p>",nav,,0,,0,,nav,,"<p>Indicator 3:  Delivery of positive impacts on the ground through a micro-grant program and a public participation program. The positive impacts can be summarized in terms of awareness, environmental activities used as a basis for poverty alleviation, and concrete activities on the ground for reversal of <br />environmental degradation. Under the UNDP-implemented components, intensive awareness campaigns on environmental issues and the role of the NBA were conducted and resulted in improved awareness of the NBA and its activities. These local activities have increased the visibility of the NBA across all the <br />countries of the Basin. Local activities were supported with 108 micro-grant interventions to demonstrate environmentally sustainable approaches for the reversal of land and water degradation, as a basis for poverty alleviation. Local beneficiaries in each country have been consulted and encouraged to <br />participate in resource management, and have developed an environmental awareness that could benefit long-term integrated basin resources management. In this process, NGOs/groups of youth and women were given the opportunity to implement local activities. <br /><br />Improved knowledge base and data sharing supported appropriate development decisions at the Basin level: In the context  of the SDAP, hydrological and economic models of the Niger Basin for key development scenarios and key sectors (irrigation, energy, livestock, etc) were developed. The results of <br />the models allowed the Niger CoM meeting to chose a specific development scenario and the Heads of State Summit, in April 2008, approved the investment program (IP) related to this specific development scenario. Without the modeling it would not have proven difficult to compare and justify the choice of one <br />of the nine potential development scenarios. The modeling allowed to have specific results in terms of impacts (on the inner delat (wetland in Mali), reduction of flow in the river, etc), and benefits (job creation, higher economic return, higher rice production, etc). The CoM had pertinent information to compare <br />development scenarios and choose the one that presents the lower impacts and the higher benefits for the Basin. This is a concrete example on how better knowledge (through the hydrological and economic models currently used in the NBA) allowed for appropriate development decisions at the Basin level. The <br />project activities also contributed to the capacity building of the Niger Basin Observatory (NBO), which is a critical department of the NBA in terms of modeling, monitoring, and providing the base of policy makers’ decisions in the basin. The support of the NBO continues to be supported by partners, mainly <br />AFD, ACDI, the EU, and GIZ.<br /><br />Environmental status monitoringhas improved during the lifetime of the project thanks to collaborative effort among partners and good coordination among the NBA implemented projects. The Niger Basin Observatoire, established in 2006, monitors hydrological status and is expected to monitor the remaining <br />28 indicators. The NBA has established an on-line catalogue of Meta data (http://georepertoire.abn.ne), providing information relative to the available data for these indicators, and conducted an assessment of the quality of existing data. The prototype for the Environmental Information System (EIS) for the Basin is <br />complete and on-line (http://sie.abn.ne). An exchange protocol is already in place for hydrological data, which started with support of the Niger-Hycos.</p>"

This will require sufficient funding for a wider range of activities and inputs, and effective partnerships will need to be formed for efficient project execution.<br />- In a phased approach, addressing issues sequentially rather than simultaneously, project duration could be too limited to achieve the required outcomes towards the project objectives. It is apparent that technical results, e.g. on gear technology, biology are required to inform the law making process; however, it is nevertheless advisable to start dealing with issues of governance and socio-economics at the earliest possible opportunity.<br />- Generic approaches to project implementation do not work if the implementation contexts for participating countries are very diverse. The participatory design of country work plans, incorporating national priorities and taking national capacities into account, as practiced in this project, is a correct approach.<br />- Financial mechanisms and other operational administrative matters, e.g. on how best to formalize arrangements with project implementing partners should receive the same attention as technical concerns. This is especially important during the preparation phase of a project in order to prevent delays in the crucial start-up period. Budget allocations per country should be closely in line with the magnitude of the tasks required in the country.<br />- Overly ambitious project designs should be avoided, and assumptions (“bycatch reduction is policy priority in participating countries”) critically verified, as these may greatly influence judgement on the achievement level of the project. Making bycatch a policy priority is actually a substantial achievement of this project.<br />- There were weaknesses in the project’s M&amp;E design, e.g. measurement of baselines, formulation and measurement of SMART indicators. M&amp;E plans for projects require considerable attention. If project partners are not fully familiar with M&amp;E purpose and processes, training input is required, in order it to be routinely and successfully applied. Participatory design of, and agreement on, specific M&amp;E plan components or tools, such as indicators, is also advisable.<br />- A layered approach in the formation of committees to provide guidance, oversight and technical advice to project implementation is correct. In-country, a careful evaluation should take place to determine whether a pre-existing body should be given the additional task and function as a national steering committee, or whether this committee should be purposely formed for a project. The latter approach should be standard. In addition, a separate technical advisory body or working group can be beneficial.</p>","<p>1. A study conducted in Iran extrapolates and quantifies the number of escaped juveniles due to By-catch Reduction Devices (BRDs) to between 400,000 and 500,000 for a single season.<br />2 Experimental by-catch reduction tests in Iran and the Philippines saw a reduction by 40% while a similar study in Mexico saw a 60% decrease.<br />3. Guide book on By-catch Reduction in Tropical Shrimp Trawl Fisheries has been produced in five languages and a 25 minute DVD on the same subject has also been released to concerned stakeholders</p>",,nap,,IWA,"<p>Most respondents underlined cooperation among countries as key supporting or success factor for achieving project results. Cooperationranged from provision of technical support (e.g. by Mexico, Nigeria and SEAFDEC) to countries of  the respective region,  participation in regional gear trials or training sessions and joint regional or global workshops, and exchange of information. In particular in the West African and Middle East regions, information was also shared during workshops with non-participating countries.

Most basically, project funding enabled countries to acquire equipment required for conducting fishing gear trials, ranging from the manufacture of BRDs to purchase of fishing gear and sensors used in measuring gear performance, and paying for ship time if not contributed voluntarily by the fishing industry as has happened in several instances. Individual capacities were upgraded through participation in training courses and workshops, as already stated above. The production and dissemination of education, information, and awareness raising materials by the project also contributed to increasing capacities. These have been expressed in the identification of potential resource management strategies or the drafting, and in some countries starting or continuing implementation of, improved management measures for the shrimp trawl fisheries. Sound management practices introduced in some countries also included effort controls, closed areas and closed seasons. The started harmonization of fisheries laws in the Southern Gulf of Guinea for joint approaches to MCS is evidence of institutional capacity development leading beyond the issue of bycatch reduction.</p>"

It is preferable to select more specific and realistic objectives for which activities can be identified and outcomes can be monitored and evaluated. Selecting too ambitious or broad objectives weakens the Logical Framework and reflects poorly on the project performance.    <br />Lessons of technical assistance: It is essential to have a clear concept of the needs for such assistance, planned activities related to the assistance and, consequently, resource and capacity requirements during the project design. In addition, working closely with the countries to identify their needs clearly is fundamental for the adoption of guidelines. The guides as well as other information relevant to capacity building for environmental stewardship should also be placed on the internet for easier access by stakeholders and other interested parties.<br />Lessons on study tours: looking at the experience of the countries with well developed, mature systems of access to information and public participation proved to be very useful because it provides motivation and concrete examples for government officials. For local NGOs, examples of the benefits of access to information bring both a base for argumentation and a means for motivation to implement positive changes in their countries. There are three crucial tasks for study tours: suitable selection of participants, a well prepared objectives and agenda that matches the needs of participants, and the development of steps to transfer the experience to the institutions represented. It would be more useful to have government participants spend more time with their respective professional counterparts during the study tour.<br />Lessons on country ownership: It is essential to involve the highest decision maker level members of the local government in earlier phases of Project design to enhance the country ownership and sustainability. <br />Lessons on cost effectiveness: In the absence of better parameters to make a cost benefit analysis, for example, for capacity building projects, it is useful to look at similar projects that have been implemented to base the cost effectiveness on a comparison of costs Vs. outputs and outcomes.<br />Lessons on needs assessments: A detailed analysis of needs and barriers at the beginning of the project was undoubtedly a beneficial initial step. For this, contacting local experts, conducting in-depth analysis of local legislation and extensive research of the practical functioning of information flows proved to be a good approach. Discussions of the assessment of needs among stakeholders and project partners will enable the development of sound target oriented recommendations for project implementation. Also this needs assessment allowed to tailor the assistance to Hungary and Slovenia respectively since Hungary is far more advanced than Slovenia in environmental regulations and information access. For example, for Slovenia, the main task of the Project was to set up a legislative framework, and in Hungary it was to improve the practical arrangements and capability building of public authorities  <br />Lessons on environmental citizenship projects: The media could play a vital role in this type of projects. Media has the power to create a supportive atmosphere for projects enhancing the rights of the public. The media can also assist to create pressure on the government to accomplish the necessary changes.<br />Lessons from existing projects: Replication efforts could also draw on a successful experience in Hungary, such as the project designed by the Ombudsman Office for Data Protection and Freedom of Information managed in cooperation with the Bacs Kiskun County. A special model has been gradually implemented in this county, where a commissioner for information, responsible for flow of information towards the public, has been established in every agency conducting public duties (including Police, Environmental Inspectorate, Public Health and Sanitation, Water Management Directorate, etc.). That  project did not present any special budgetary requirements, only reorganization of staff.  The office of ombudsman prepared materials, conducted site visits, lectures, consultations and provided technical assistance. <br />Lessons on replicability: Capacity building projects to enable activities or to produce change in government sectors should outline a comprehensive capacity building system post-project for a significant segment of relevant public officials to produce effective changes. This replication outline should incorporate the lessons learned and could include courses to train-the-trainers. Furthermore, according to EMLA (one of the Hungarian NGOs involved in the project) several project participants seemed to be prepared to use the Handbooks to train colleagues at other agencies. The project could have built on this initiative.<br /><br />1) While there were many common obstacles to the provision of information in Hungary and Slovenia, there do exist a number of barriers and issues unique to each country.  Thus, combining country-driven approaches with regional ones was an efficient strategy supported by the country project partners. <br /><br />2) Flexibility to incorporate bottom up initiatives by project partners increased interest and country ownership and led to better cooperation with government and NGO stakeholders.<br /><br />3) Broad input by NGO, governmental and other stakeholders, along with transparency, helped to mobilize experience and expertise and gain support for the project.  This helped make the project more acceptable to government officials and contributed to its overall success.  However, it also became clear that it is imperative to develop the genuine support of high-level officials in order to make sure that project results are implemented.<br /><br />5) The Needs Assessment reports prepared in the first phase of the project presented an excellent and thorough basis for defining project activities, priorities, and more specific outputs. It would be even more helpful to prepare such needs assessments as part of the designing phase of projects. However, this would need a different approach in the GEF project cycle, including provision of a certain amount of early funding, to enable applying organizations to be involved.</p>","<p>Key results: <br />1. High quality needs assessments were conducted on how to improve public access to environmental information in Hungary and Slovenia.<br /><br />2. Capacities were increased for improving access to information in both countries via workshops, study tours and printed and electronic information.<br /><br />3. A new quality of cooperation was achieved between NGOs and government officials.</p>","<p>Many representatives from other Danube countries participated on the final workshop in Slovenia in October 2001. This meeting was used not only for dissemination of the Project results, but also for identification of the needs in participating countries, in order to determine the basis for continuation of the Pilot Project. This is an effective step to actively include representatives of target countries into design and implementation of follow up projects. The project should have outlined a comprehensive post-project capacity building system for a substantial segment of relevant public officials in Hungary and Slovenia to achieve the Development Objective, particularly from regional offices.</p>",nav,,IWA,"<p>Ratification of the Aarhus Convention in Hungary and mobilization of capacities to improve access to environmental information in Slovenia. For example, an NGO coalition for Aarhus ratification now works in Slovenia, and REC Slovenia has set up a new project &quot;Towards Efficient Access to Environmental Information and Public Participation in Slovenia through Ratification and Implementation of Aarhus Convention&quot;, which is based on outputs of the GEF Project and is currently achieving its first successes. Also collaboration and communications between NGOs and government officials has improved and there is a positive attitude in government officials regarding information requests. For example, shortly after a joint workshop, improved collaboration between the Clean Air Action group and the Central Danube Valley Water Authority in Hungary led to an exceptionally prompt solution of illegal timber logging in the Danube River valley. Another example was better cooperation between the Ministry of the Environment, the Ministry of Transportation and Water Management and NGOs in Hungary; and</p>",nap,,IWA,"<p>Good opportunities for influencing legislation drafting in Slovenia.

[Target: One Needs Assessment completed for each country.]<br /><br />Barriers to the public access of environmental information were identified, described and analyzed in two Needs Assessments, one each for Hungary and Slovenia.  The Needs Assessments were used as a basis to identify priorities for the project activities, and were made broadly available on a project website.  Barriers were illustrated through case studies that were later used as concrete implementation examples in capacity building workshops.  The final project recommendations dealt with options for removing these barriers.  This project phase may prove highly valuable for other countries beyond the two pilot ones.<br /><br /><br />INDICATOR #2:  Capacity built in the governments of Hungary and Slovenia to establish the legal, institutional, social and practical infrastructure that is a prerequisite to increasing public participation in efforts to protect the Danube from nutrient and toxic discharges.   [Target: Three capacity building workshops and one study tour completed for Hungarian and Slovenian government officials and NGO representatives.]<br /><br />• Four capacity building workshops were organized, two in each country.  A final capacity building event was organized in the form of a joint regional workshop where the results and lessons learned were discussed and evaluated in the presence of government and NGO experts from other Danube countries.  While the Hungarian participants decided to focus on institutional and practical improvements, Slovenian participants concentrated on legislative improvements.<br />• A study tour was organized for three government officials and one NGO representative from each country to visit the Netherlands and the US.  Participants got a substantial overview of legislative background as well as particular information about implementation mechanisms and daily practices of the host country governments on how to provide and access information regimes. Sessions were held on how to apply in practice the experiences gained in the Netherlands and US in Hungary and Slovenia. The tour participants prepared a report for their countries assessing the lessons learned, and made recommendations on experiences and practices that could be used in their countries.  The project and its materials were presented in several different Aarhus Convention-related events in both countries and in an NGO national meeting in Hungary.<br />• At the request of the Hungarian and Slovenian project participants, a 3-day “mini study tour” was organized to provide opportunities for learning and exchange. Slovenian participants had meetings with key officials of Hungarian environmental and water related Ministries and were provided information on mechanisms to promote public participation.<br />• Hungary ratified the Aarhus Convention on July 3, 2001, a goal that was supported by the project.<br /><br /><br /><br />INDICATOR #3: Reinforcement of the role of non-governmental actors in efforts to reduce discharges into the Danube. [Target: Improved legislative and institutional framework and better government practices to provide more opportunities for NGOs to access information and to participate in environmental decision-making.]<br /><br />In both model countries, representatives of the governmental and NGO sectors appreciated the opportunities provided to discuss controversial issues, to gain better understanding, to eliminate prejudice and to build mutual confidence.  One example of this is the cooperation between the Clean Air Action group and the Central Danube Valley Water Authority in Hungary. Shortly after a joint workshop, their cooperation led to an exceptionally prompt solution of illegal timber logging in the Danube River valley.<br /><br /><br />INDICATOR #4: Materials developed and disseminated concerning replicable elements of the pilot program.   [Target:  Printed materials and website developed and disseminated.]<br /><br />The results of the project were disseminated through: the project list-serve; a major e-mailing to approximately 600 people worldwide who follow public access to environmental and water related information issues; communications through IW Learn; and the web sites of the Regional Environmental Center for Central and Eastern Europe and project partners.  Printed outputs included a Citizen Guide and a Practices Manual.  A Hungarian handbook for public authorities was mailed to all project partners and participants, relevant national government officials and the environmental officials of 1500 municipalities.</p>"

The  project assisted in the development of a new “Agreement for the Protection and Sustainable Development  of Lake Ohrid and its Watershed” which significantly expanded the composition and powers of the Lake  Ohrid Management Board comprising representatives from both countries.  The project contributed to the  process of revising environmental legislation that would regulate environmental assessment of new  projects.  <br /><br />INDICATOR #2:  Participatory Watershed Management Committees  (PWMC)  adopt watershed  Action Programs to promote future targeted and priority activities and programs to protect the Lake  and its watershed.   A community awareness program was developed and implemented that helped  establish effective WMCs.  Comprehensive watershed Action Programs were completed by the PWMCs and  joint Action Programs were endorsed by the Lake Ohrid Management Board. Priority actions were further  endorsed by the government of Macedonia<br /><br />The objective, to provide a transboundary, comprehensive approach to the management of the Lake Ohrid watershed, combining restoration, conservation and protection of the lake with sustainable use of its natural resources, was codified into a new transboundary treaty “Agreement for the Protection and Sustainable Development of Lake Ohrid and its Watershed.” This treaty was signed by both countries in June 2004 and fully ratified by both countries in the spring of 2005. It provides a sustainable legal framework for long-term watershed management that is proactive and fully consistent with the EU Water Framework Directive. While implementation is just beginning and much depends on how this occurs, it is rare for a project to result in a completely new and comprehensive legal structure for joint management among two countries. The negotiation, signing and ratification of this treaty are significant achievements and bode well for the future. The LOCP was the first GEF project of its kind in Southeastern Europe, and it has been recognized internationally as a successful model of bilateral management of transboundary resources. Delegates at a 2003 Athens conference hosted by Greece, during its Presidency of the EU, and the World Bank recommended that others in the region use the lessons learned in the LOCP to help guide their projects, especially noting how joint activities at the local level had significantly strengthened the collaboration between the two countries (The World Bank 2003). The long-term project goal, to conserve and protect the natural resources and biodiversity of Lake Ohrid, has been enabled and can be achieved with continued efforts under the new agreement. Three years of monitoring document water quality concerns, but also a diverse ecosystem that remains resilient. Although the amount is unquantified, nutrient loads have undoubtedly been reduced by project activities, (particularly the construction of manure platforms and the reforestation projects) and substantial investments of other donors in wastewater collection and treatment are underway and will significantly increase these reductions. The average lakewide phosphorus concentration is still below the level usually used to indicate oligotrophic condition. The Project’s “State of the Environment” analysis shows that changes in species composition are occurring, and some hot spots of concern exist, but no species have been eliminated and the overall condition of the ecosystem is still acceptable. As the transbounday treaty and joint Action Program are implemented, additional improvements in the ecosystem should occur.</p>",IW3,<p>Lake Ohrid Watershed Committee</p>,nav,,nav,,nav,,nav,,nav,,nav,,0,,0,,nav,,<p>nav</p>

The TDA/SAP approach in the GEF IW Programme has proven its value across many projects. Lessons from the BSERP suggest that the process of revising TDAs and SAPs should not be the rational for a continuation project. It is important to reassess and update environmental status, and to identify possible changes in pressures, and the TDA provides a very good format for this. However TDA revisions and SAP updates should be periodic/ongoing activities managed by the transboundary waters commissions, with project PIUs playing a supporting role. Taking this responsibility to an internationally funded project runs the real risk of lowering country ownership and responsibility. Of course, there needs to be a well-managed and adequately funded Commission in place to take on TDA/SAP development responsibilities<br />2. The BSERP utilized an independent scientific body (e.g BSERP International Study Group) to identify the agenda for applied research through the joint research cruises. This concept should be considered for replication in other projects. An ISG enables top scientists in the region to engage with the project, and ensure that applied research efforts are science rather than policy driven. The BSERP ISG ran into some difficulties with the publication of information culled from the research cruises. It took far too long to get information out, and there have been reported instances where published works from the research effort did not cite the financial contribution of UNDP/GEF/BSERP.<br />3. The Black Sea region during the last 10 years has witnessed a significant reduction in support for marine sciences and regional research institutes. Previously well-staffed and funded institutes were stripped of their funding and in a precarious financial position. IW projects like the BSERP have become a critical lifeline for research on marine and riverine issues. This suggests a two-fold consideration: first the extent to which national support for the participating research institutes should be a pre-condition for GEF support, and then consideration on the types of support – such as training and capacity building, that should be included in the project activities. Central and eastern European countries are full of laboratories with high priced internationally-funded machinery but no spare parts or consumables, few technicians with the skills to operate the machinery, and few assignments where the machinery is needed.<br />4. The BSERP Steering Committee made a strategic decision during the project first phase to hire full time paid Country Team Leaders in each of the six countries to help coordinate activities. The decision was made based at the urging of the participating countries and reflecting some difficulties in getting the involved Ministries to follow through on expected commitments. The CTL effort received generally strong support from the stakeholders interviewed, raising the question whether this approach should be replicated in other projects.<br />There can be some benefit to taking a CTL approach to project management in special cases, however this approach should be avoided where possible due to significant downside risks. On the positive side, hiring CTLs can enable projects to expand country activities and improve coordination in situations where the responsible agency is not managing the effort well. As to the downside risks:<br />o CTLs constitute a major cost factor for multi-country projects. What is typically expected as a co-financing cost born by the partner countries becomes an administrative cost to the project – thereby reducing available funds for demonstration projects and other technical assistance.<br />o There is an important issue at stake concerning country ownership and sustainability. If the countries are not financially responsible for in-county project management, they are less likely to have a stake in the outputs and productivity of the CTLs and project as a whole.<br />o If the in-country coordination is paid for by the project – then at the end of the project there are likely to be problems in terms of sustaining the effort. The BSERP devised a phase out strategy over the final 18 months to scale back CTL financial support – with the expectation that the countries would escalate their support.<br />o If CTL‟s are to play a technical role they need technical skills. This requires a transparent CTL selection process that can identify persons with the requisite technical capabilities.<br />o CTLs paid for by the project but selected by the responsible Ministry officials encounter loyalty and „chain of command‟ pressures. Who are they responsible to and how can they be replaced if they fail to perform their proscribed duties?<br />The reality in some countries is that the responsible Ministries and their staff are already overburdened and have little capacity to take on more obligations, and budgets are not increased to cover the in-kind contribution obligations made when signing up for the GEF project. It may be that future GEF projects can address this issue through carrying out a more extensive needs assessment of each participating country during project development, and generating a more detailed and „honest‟ assessment of expected country in-kind contributions. Such an approach could lead to a differential support structure for projects – where countries may be eligible for direct support for in-country coordination if it is clear they cannot participate otherwise. More capable countries would then be supported only through indirect mechanisms such as demonstration projects. The UNDP/GEF Danube Project experienced this situation during the second phase and elected to hire a full time CTL only for Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was well-justified on the basis of the split government structure in that country.<br />5. Exit Strategies can help countries focus on the eventual closure of a GEF support project and consideration of what they will do to sustain and replicate activities. The BSERP/BSC Exit Strategy is quite brief and lacks an array of options (based on available budget) nonetheless, it includes useful comments and recommendations, and it builds upon the institutional review developed for the BSC, so the two taken together constitute a reasonable consideration of how to strengthen the capacity of the BSC to carry out its intended mission(s) over the short, medium and long terms.<br />6. One of the key concepts behind Exit Strategies is to set in motion a gradual phase out of project support, especially for Commission and Advisory Group meetings, with the partner countries increasing their budgets to compensate. The BSERP Exit Strategy establishes no such recommendations for funding phase down, and there is no indication that discussions were held with the Commission members (in their dual role as Steering Committee Members) on a phased transfer of financial responsibility.<br />7. The institutional strengthening aspects of GEF IW projects, especially when they include support for a Permanent Secretariat, need further consideration and revision. In the Black Sea project, similar to the Danube experience, the relationship between project PIU and Commission Secretariat is complicated and fraught with potential problems – especially relating to span of control and decision-making authority on how budgets are allocated. Project Documents need to clarify in far greater detail this relationship. For the Black Sea, the problem was initially exacerbated by having a separate steering committee structure for the Project and the Commission. During the 2nd phase, this was altered, with Commission members also participating as Project Steering Committee members.<br />8. The BSERP small grants effort builds upon successful small grants sub-programmes in several of the GEF full size projects. In light of these achievements, UNDP and GEF should consider expanding the budget for NGO small grants components, but better integrating them into the strategic planning for many of the planned project outputs. So, for example, NGO small grants should be a key aspect of the communications and public awareness strategy, with NGO‟s providing specific inputs that help the project meet its strategic aims. Likewise, there should be room for NGO participation in pilot studies, environmental monitoring, education and training activities.<br /><br />1)  BSEP and BSSAP corresponded to the countries' priorities and were implemented at the onset of the regional co-operation towards the Black Sea protection. Thanks to these merits, the projects achieved remarkable results--some of them of historical importance--despite challenges. Both projects illustrate well-conceived development concepts, and are examples of the importance that timely implementation of a project has long-standing impacts on beneficiaries.<br /><br />2)  The multifaceted nature of IW projects means that a variety of skills are needed in project teams, including the “diplomatic” skills required to coordinate with senior government officials, to push legislative recommendations, and to provide training and capacity building.  In addition to ensuring these skills receive prominence during team selection, there may be benefit from developing a Project Managers manual, with advice for teams as they begin.<br /><br />3)  The BSERP utilized an independent scientific body (the BSERP International Study Group) to identify the agenda for applied research through the joint research cruises.  This concept should be considered for replication in other projects.  An ISG enables top scientists in the region and world-wide to engage with the project. It can ensure that applied research efforts are science rather than policy driven, with results duly informing national decision-making process.  A key challenge in this approach is to develop a clear set of agreed objectives and timetables for ISG deliverables, closely aligned to the overall project objectives. <br /><br />4)  While deployment of Country Team Leaders (CTLs) by the BSERP has been seen by many stakeholders as being beneficial to its implementation, there are associated downside risks to this approach.  It imposes an administrative cost to the project, reducing available funds for demonstration projects and other technical assistance. Also, while the intent is to increase country ownership and engage with national stakeholders, if the countries are not financially responsible for in-country management, ownership may lag and long-term sustainability becomes at risk.  To counter the second risk, the BSERP devised a phase out strategy over the final 18 months to scale back CTL financial support – with the expectation that the countries would escalate their support.</p>","<p>1. A Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA) was prepared, leading to a Black Sea Strategic Action Plan, and both were revisited after 10 years and updated in Phase II of the project.<br /><br />2. All six Black Sea countries developed National Strategic Action Plans.<br /><br />3. The key issue identified in the TDA/SAP – the need to reduce nutrient inputs to the Black Sea, especially from the Danube – was addressed through investment, policy and regulatory reform, capacity building, scientific research, and public outreach, resulting in reduced Danube pollution loads and clear signs of recovery of the Black Sea ecosystem, including the elimination of the NW shelf hypoxic zone.</p>",,nav,,IW3,<p>Convention</p>,IW3,"<p>Operational structures and management tools of the Black Sea Commission were strengthened, including an Institutional Strengthening Review and an Exit Strategy.<br />• A draft Legally Binding Document on Fisheries was approved by the BSC in 2004.</p>",IW2,"<p>• Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) was strengthened in line with EU Directives.

Achievement for this output can be considered satisfactory.<br />The TDA though has been issued rather late. A preliminary first draft was available in autumn 2006; the final draft was issued in January 2007. A combination of factors is responsible for the delays, including the time needed by the PIU for planning, for identification of local experts and for issuing subcontracts; the time needed for acquiring the data (there were 66 contributing specialists); data being provided in various formats (despite prescribed templates) and with a varying quality (requiring extra checks).</p>",IW4,"<p>The SAP revision effort was carried out in the project 2nd phase, commencing after the TDA was completed in January 2007.

A consultant working for the Black Sea Commission has been detailed to make revisions, supported by a full-time BSERP PIU staff member.<br />There have been extensive negotiations with all of the countries, and major revisions to the draft based upon country comments.

Even if a project consists of relatively separate components that can be implemented more or less independently, it would be important to have an overall project coordinator with clear management responsibilities and who can exercise adaptive management, prepare workplans and suggest budget revisions. It is the responsibility of the implementing agency to ensure that an adequate structure and procedures are in place.<br /> Systematic M&amp;E procedures should be applied in the context measuring the success of training events and workshops in relation to the objectives of such events. By evaluating the use and application of new skills by participants post-training, guidance can be obtained as to how to make capacity building as effective as possible.<br /> When working with partners that are not familiar with international development procedures or the planning and reporting requirements of UNEP (or other agencies), the implementing agency has to provide sufficient information – or evening training – to ensure that all involved understand and are able to adequately participate in progress monitoring according to prevailing requirements.<br /> The closer the collaboration with project managers and decision-makers at the country level and in the field the better the chances that project results are taken up and used in management. GEF/LME project managers and country representatives should be involved from the beginning in project design in order for their needs to be reflected in project activities.<br /> Adequate resources and activities need to be included for “bridging the gap” between science and practical implementation. It is not sufficient to train only scientists but opportunities have to given for scientists and politicians, managers and others to interact, the scientific results need to be promoted and direct support for local implementation of new approaches need to be ensured.<br /> Disseminating results widely and paying special attention to reaching key target audiences is important to create awareness and solicit support also from secondary stakeholders and the general public. This may be particularly important with regard to a subject matter such as ecosystem-based fisheries management in an LME context that requires interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral collaboration and that is still a relatively new concept. Publishing reports in series that are widely distributed is essential in this respect. It is also important to publish results in a format and in a language that are suitable for the intended audience.</p>",,"<p>62. The Project was designed to play a catalytic role and for supporting GEF/LME projects in the development and implementation of scientifically sound approaches to ecosystem-based fisheries management. Unfortunately, as mentioned earlier, the database and network activities of Component 1 did not produce the results hoped for and the results of the other components have not yet been brought into wider application. Nevertheless, the catalytic potential of the main Project outputs remain and would appear likely to be realised in the future. The TE evaluator was<br />also informed by NOAA that the outputs already contribute positively to the GEF IW portfolio, the proposed UN Global Marine Assessment, the Assessment of Assessment process and the Transboundary International Waters Assessment although this information was not substantiated by written evidence.<br />63. The Project made use of existing approaches and structures, developing and adapting them to the needs of GEF/LME projects. The EwE, Nitrogen export and particle size spectra modelling approaches existed already but had generally not been adapted to developing countries and the LME management context. The Project worked more closely with some GEF/LME projects –through the participation of individuals from LME regions – but also developed basic models and information for all 64 LMEs in the world. As mentioned in paragraph 40 above, these Project results constitute tools that can be used for further work by individual LMEs or as a basis for global analyses and studies.<br />64. In order to capitalise on the catalytic potential of Project outputs, these – in particular the UNEP and IOC/UNESCO publications (see paragraph 60) – need to be disseminated as widely as possible to the key target audience of policy and decision-makers and managers involved in or having an influence on ecosystem, fisheries and LME management and be supported by outreach activities. Follow-up activities, both with regard to replication (additional training and workshops) and more direct support to their application at the LME level would also be important.</p>",nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,-1,,-1,,nap,,

Trust embodies keeping promises― following through on commitments—and being consistently credible with information<br />used to inform and educate. Without question, these have been important keys to the network established in Namibia and South Africa throughout this MSP and even before the pilot phase of DLIST. In fact, this evaluation finds that the effort of EcoAfrica in general and the CTA in particular, laid an important foundation in developing trust among this region’s constituents. Although difficult to quantify, this will be an essential factor in whether the DLIST model can be established elsewhere, and careful attention will need to be given to fostering trust from the outset when expanding into new locations. Trust has to be engendered across all levels (i.e. technical projects, as well as government and local stakeholders) and this takes time to cultivate. EcoAfrica continues to do a good job in recruiting staff, as well as focal points and individuals, who engender trust and integrity and serve as local champions. From the interviews conducted, the relationships that have been developed by this cadre of specialists (i.e. multiple points of contact, as identified in the GEF Experience Note) have been an important factor in DLIST’s success thus far. DLIST should continue to be aware of this as it moves into different regions, and should approach establishing new networks along the lines and recommendations identified above.<br />Obviously, ICT has the potential to reach a broad constituency, even in regional developing environments where Internet connectivity is a challenge. But ICT is only a small part (and partial facilitator) of a larger challenge in developing and maintaining a community of practice. As stated in a recent, popular advertisement from CISCO Systems, a world provider of computer switches and electronic communication solutions: “Welcome to the human network”. Even among big business in developed countries, ICT providers recognize that technology merely provides a supportive, facilitating role and it is the relationships among people with similar interests in distant locations that will remain the most important ingredient. As demonstrated by DLIST, there are many formats and approaches to facilitate this, and its future should continue to use M&amp;E as an adaptive mechanism to match the most appropriate tool(s) to local conditions.<br />Strategies to achieve a sustainable network are time and resource intensive to set up and maintain, and future DLIST operations will require the necessary support to establish and sustain them. Like the network marketing of products, some participants will remain brand-loyal and there will be attrition among others, but maintenance through routine communication and trust will be the foundation of success.<br />While maintaining such a network takes time and money, leveraging resources in small amounts and seeking win-win arrangements among local stakeholders fosters a sense of ownership, and has been proven as a successful strategy in Namibia and South Africa during this MSP. One observation that stood out during the evaluation interviews was the strong ethic expressed, especially by those interviewed in Namibia, concerning the responsibility of environmental and social stewardship for the future. This was not a once or twice observation, but a consistent philosophy and ethic expressed by professionals and local stakeholders. Identifying champions/leaders and then offering the appropriate leverage to realize a vision or dream for their local communities provides the kind of empowerment that proves a network’s worth, and fosters longer term commitment by its<br />members, and future leaders to assume the helm. DLIST has demonstrated much strength and experience in working toward such a goal, and with adjustments (of which it is already aware) and additional modifications, it will continue to serve as an important regional information network for the coastal and marine resources of Africa.</p>",,,nav,,nap,,nap,,nav,<p>complete</p>,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,-1,,-1,,nav,,

The project has proven to have a high demonstration value. Its success can be attributed to:<br />(i) Borrower's and the Bank's approach to the project and commitment to its objectives. The Bank utilized a muiltidisciplinary team of a financial analyst, port engineer, and marine environmental specialist.  This provided consistency throughout, from design and appraisal to implementation. While several administrations and agencies were involved in the project, key leadership was provided by OMMP, ensuring a national consistency and provideng a mechanism to utilize model components in other ports, and a regional coordination with the other beneficiaries. Furthermore, GOT has a well-established base of environmental laws and agencies, with trained staff, to monitor and enforce these laws; i.e., the project could build on a strong existing base.<br />(ii) Borrower's commitment to contribute to the financing of the project<br />(iii) Port and coastal environmental management is inherently complex due to overlapping jurisdictions of different departments and ministries, port authorities, and private interests. If Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco did not strongly commit themselves to the project and have existing efficient port institutions, and had not created the CRCP base upon which the project could be constructed, coupled with good organization arrangement for project implementation, this project would have been much more difficult to implement. Replication and/or extending this project to other countries can be successful if there are established regulatory and management regimes suitable to the task. Alternatively, such regimes should be first established and stabilized.<br />(iv) Through enhancing and upgrading national standards, policies, procedures for waste monioring, and rehabilitation of waste reception and handling facilities, the project has convinced GOT of the environmental benefit of the investments. This has triggered adoption of a multiport ship waste tracking system, a port oil spill contingency and response plan for major Tunisian ports, and the holding of oil spill response training exercises to train all port and other agencies.<br />(v) Management of oil spills is only one aspect of port and coastal maritime environmental management. The success of the project can be further enhanced by (a) adoption of an environmental coastal zone and port mangement plan &quot;(a concept already being initated by OMMP); and (b) implementation of other pollution control activitie s(e.g., control and management of land-based sources of pollution).</p>","<p>Tunisia<br />1.

Cooperation is considered highly satisfactory. CRCP members meet regularly and have been able to handle regional procurement and succeeded in ensuring continuous coordination among involved administrations in their respective countries.<br /><br />The project has contributed to efficient cooperation among concerned administrations and within the region to prevent and control oil pollution. The development of a sub-regional working group and organization of joint training contributed to enhancing marine pollution management through development of a common approach and mechanisms. The project has improved the countries' capabilities to deal with accidental oil spills and provide equipment and facilities to collect and treat oily ballast and bilge waters, thus reducing hydrocarbon contamination in the Mediterranean. The project has created the foundation for permanent cooperation in the region in terms of monitoring and compliance auditing, state of marine pollution reporting, and a common approach for spill response.

When planning or initiating such an undertaking, it is crucial to communicate properly its intent. The purpose of the facility was to treat wastewater, not to create wetland habitats for species conservation. Ironically, several species of birds now nest in the engineered wetlands, proving through their presence the effectiveness of water treatment.<br /><br />4) The development of a Business Plan for the facility only at project end creates difficulties for agencies to set their budgets and staffing effectively.

This does not mean that the design of GEF projects should become even more cumbersome, but rather the design should,inter alia:<br />a) differentiate clearly between ‘objectives’ and ‘outputs’ and be more rigorous in their description in order to avoid creating false expectations (e.g. not to state emphatically that an output will be approved at the highest level of government, when in most cases this is something very difficult to predict);<br />b) establish a clear sequence between the ‘objectives’, the ‘outputs’ required to achieve each one of the objectives, and all the ‘activities’ that should be undertaken in order to generate each one of the outputs;<br />c) be more attentive to the ‘real world’ situation of the eligible countries, and not to assume that a GEF project will be able to change some strongly-rooted social and institutional realities;<br />d) in region-wide projects, curry out a more rigorous assessment of the institutional and technical capacity to implement the project in each eligible country (e.g. not assume that they are all at the same level). The findings of this assessment should be incorporated in the project design concerning the outputs, the activities that should lead to generate them, and the implementation approach (e.g. in the project under review, the project should have planned for more project personnel to work with different groups of countries in the region); and<br />e) foresee which key stakeholders should be involved in the project implementation and/or in receiving and accepting the outputs, so as to incorporate into the project an implementation approach that would ensure the involvement of those stakeholders. <br /><br />The eligible countries should be more actively involved in the project design, so that:<br />a) they can assist in making the project more attune to their needs and capacities to deliver; and<br />b) they can be prompted to start considering the required and implementable in-country mechanisms in advance of the start of the project. This would ensure speedy implementation once the project is approved. (One key problem of the project under review was that the key in-country mechanism was established very late in most countries, and in some it was never established.)<br />In the case of region-wide projects involving transboundary issues, it will be very important:<br />a) to formally involve all countries in the region, including those that are not GEF-eligible, in the design and implementation of the project. Otherwise, the outputs of the project would be in jeopardy if not all the countries concerned with the transbounday issues follow the same pace;<br />b) to ensure that there is a meaningful and effective coordination mechanism imbedded in the project design to allow all countries to share experiences and to develop the sense of ‘shared issues’; and <br />c) to make arrangements within the project for technical and financial bilateral assistance within the region.<br /><br />The duration of a project should be such as to ensure that the necessary key results are achieved. The alternative would be to foresee the immediate follow-up that will be required to ensure that the project outputs are put to good use. (In the case of the project under review, the project duration did not allow time for carrying out required processes to obtain high-level government approval of the key outputs, and no followup was foreseen to do this. As a result, the long term impact of the project is uncertain.)<br /><br />Implementing agencies should not wait until formal approval of the project to start looking into the selection of project personnel. If necessary, the rules should be amended as to allow ‘pre-recruitment’ of project personnel to ensure speedy implementation once the project is approved. (In the case of the project under review, the project manager came on board six month after the project had started.) In other words, it should not be taken for granted that ‘this is the way that the UN/the GEF operates…’.</p>",,"<p>The project, with due adaptation and using the lessons learnt in the Mediterranean, could be quite easily replicated in other Regional Seas.</p>",nav,,IW3,<p>Barcelona</p>,IW3,<p>MAP</p>,IWA,"<p>The project produced a set of the ‘regional guidelines’ and ‘regional plans’ for preparing the NAPs, including a National Diagnostic Analysis (NDA) and National<br />Baseline Budget (NBB). It should be noted that the NBB was an ‘add on’, not contemplated in the original project document, and financed to a large extent with<br />MED POL resources. Training courses were organized for their application. It should be noted, though, that the guidelines were not ‘adopted at the regional level’, and possibly there was no need for that.</p>",IW4,"<p>14. Concerning the TDA, which was under the responsibility of MED POL:<br />a) a 200-page full-coloured publication: Transboundary Diagnistic Analysis (TDA) for the Mediterranean Sea (UNEP/MAP/MED POL, Athens, 2005) contains the up-dated TDA (originally produced in 1997), which is the result of work carried out as part of this GEF project;<br />b) the TDA provides the technical basis for refinement of the National Action Programs (NAPs) for the protection of the marine environment from land-based sources and the SAP MED in the area of international waters of the GEF;<br />c) it also provides the expert opinion on the state of the environment and priority problems, and a list of actions that are recommended for consideration. This list is designed to address the major transboundary issues in the GEF focal area related to international waters;<br />d) the TDA process identified three Environmental Quality Objectives (EQOs) as major goals for the Mediterranean environment and made used of the Strategic action programme for the conservation of biological diversity in the Mediterranean region (SAP BIO) and of the Code of Conduct for Fisheries, which led to specific targets and interventions that can be considered in the NAPs; and <br />e) the TDA now constitutes a significantly stronger tool, both from a scientific as well as strategic point of view, at the disposal of MAP and each of the Parties<br />to the Barcelona Convention (including those which are not GEF-eligible) to undertake the required actions to protect the Mediterranean Sea.</p>",IW2,"<p>The SAP MED was completed, with targets and needed activities at regional and national level structured in two areas (urban and industrial) and a number of categories within each area.

While this appears to have been a deliberate choice in the early years of the project, core staffing was affected in later years by budgetary shortfalls and by rigorous effort to keep expenditure on project management below 10 per cent of overall project expenditure, in line with GEF guidelines.  Turnover in the fisheries officer position was exacerbated by the short term nature of contracts offered. <br /><br />The shortfall in technical staffing is associated with shortfalls in delivery on components 2, 3 and 4 of the project, including in supervision of and support to the RACs, and to a lesser extent in communications. While engagement of technical partners provided important expertise in these areas, it is likely that additional technical support in these areas would have ensured greater continuity and follow through at national level, and overcome the rather fragmented delivery in some parts of the project.   <br /><br />A general lesson related to RCU capacity is to ensure sufficient resources are allocated to ensure stable strategic and regional level technical support for planning, pilot implementation activities and development of national policy in specific thematic areas, alongside the more general support for foundational activities.  Budgeting options include either a more generous interpretation of the ‘10 per cent rule’ for regional projects with specific reference to technical <br />roles that provide for better coordination and economies of scale in project execution or inclusion of key regional positions in activity budgets. Precedents for the latter option include the 2005-2010 WIO-LaB project. This lesson is of relevance to GEF International Waters (IW) projects and potentially to other regional GEF projects<br /><br />The assignment of the RCU as Secretariat for the IGCC in 2006 was envisaged in the Project Documents and had the potential to save funds and provide a long term vehicle for sustainability of project results. In retrospect the approach can be seen to have engendered difficulties in a number of areas.  The dual role created confusion in terms of accountability and generated a false sense of security in terms of financial support for the (I)GCC.  The structure made the RCU a champion for the future GCC but made it inherently difficult for it to play an impartial facilitation role.  In addition the IGCC Secretariat was unable to deliver on requests of the Ministers that fell outside the immediate scope of the project. <br /><br />The nature of the relationship between regional GEF projects and the regional institutional mechanisms that they help to create and establish can be expected to differ on a case by case basis. However, the lesson from this project of relevance to GEF International Waters and other regional projects is to ensure a clear independence between a GEF project and the institutional mechanism from the outset of planning for such a mechanism<br /><br />The total reported co-finance comes to just US$ 10.0 million, or 29 per cent of the amount pledged, with much of the deficit accounted for by the GCLME countries.  The shortfall reflects both a failure by countries to mobilise pledged funds but also the limited reporting of cash and in kind support by project partners . <br /><br />Reasons for failure to mobilise co-finance evoked during country visits and in the questionnaire responses included lack of visibility of the project at national and ministerial level; time passed since the Project Brief was approved in 2003; lack of direct funding from the project to leverage co-finance; difficulties in mobilizing co-finance at the start and close of a the project due to budget cycles; shortfalls in resources; and, inability to capture in kind contributions of other <br />national institutions.  Many of these are issues that may have been at least partly averted had the RCU maintained a dialogue regarding co-financing from the outset of the project. However, they also point to repercussions associated with the relatively low visibility of GEF foundational projects with an emphasis on regional planning compared to shorter term national implementation projects. <br /><br />The problems associated with mobilising co-finance in this project will not necessarily recur in future GEF projects in view of the revised approach to co-finance in the GEF-5. However general lessons for all GEF projects can be drawn in terms of the need i) to maintain a dialogue with GEF focal points and future partners regarding programming of cofinance and ii) to systematically track contributions so that any issues can be identified at an early stage.  <br /><br />This evaluation has not looked specifically at the nature and causes of irregularities that led to the project suspension in 2007 and 2008 since these were thoroughly investigated by UNIDO IOS and appropriate follow up actions were taken.  <br /><br />Repercussion of the suspension included loss of time, loss of institutional memory and loss of momentum, in part associated with the uncertainty and loss of confidence amongst the GCLME countries as to whether and in what form the project would continue. <br /><br />A straightforward lesson for any GEF projects experiencing suspension or other discontinuities in activities is to ensure regular communication is maintained with project stakeholders, even if it is not possible to provide definite information regarding the prospects for project continuation.</p>","<p>1. Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA) developed and disseminated to all stakeholders <br />2. Strategic Action Programme (SAP) developed, adopted and National Action Programs (NAP) prepared and validated by 15 IGCC member states with costed Investment Projects.<br />3. Decision by Ministers of 16 IGCC member states to establish the Guinea Current Commission</p>","<p>The project has contributed to creation of a more enabling environment for management of the GCLME through its foundational activities linked to institutional strengthening and policy development and through its substantial investments in individual and organizational capacity building.  Financing is addressed under Sustainability, above.  <br /><br />The principal outcomes in terms of institutional change have been the creation of the IGCC and decision to create the GCC through a protocol to the Abidjan Convention. While this decision has strong catalytic potential, financial sustainability is a concern. <br /><br />The SAP includes a recommendation that the RACs or regional ‘centres of excellence’ that were recognised in the first year of the project should become central actors in the SAP implementation. In practice the RACs are operating  as service providers in response to requests and funding from the RCU rather than as drivers or champions of change and their ongoing role needs further consideration.   <br /><br />Institutional change at the national level has been limited since the IMCs are operating on an informal basis, but the GCLME does now have an identified institutional host in each of the countries.   There is potential for reinforcement of national coordination structures in a future SAP implementation project.  <br /><br />Potentially catalytic activities at the regional level in terms of policy include the amendment and drafting of protocols to the Abidjan Convention including adoption of the revised Emergency Protocol and regional emergency plan and anticipated adoption of the protocol on LBSA. A draft regional ballast water convention document has been prepared.   <br /><br />There is little evidence of national policy changes in key sectors such as fisheries, pollution and habitat management, but the legal studies, SAP and NAP, NPAs on land-based sources, and sectoral plans such as the regional fisheries management plans and biodiversity plans do pave the way for future actions in this area.  Guinea Bissau reported that it had acceded to two IMO Conventions as a result of the project.  <br /><br />With regard to mainstreaming of results of pilot projects, plans developed by two of the pilot projects – the ICZM project in Cameroon and the MPAs project in Benin (including a draft decree)  – were validated at technical level. However there is little real ownership of the results by the focal institutions and there are no current plans for further implementation in the absence of dedicated project funding. The project in Nigeria was instrumental in drawing attention to the <br />importance of mangroves and stimulating increased efforts in mangrove management in the Federal Ministry of Environment, and the Nigeria representative reported a significant budget allocation in this area in May 2012.  Terminal Evaluation Report – GCLME Page 34 <br /><br />The project has invested substantially in training of scientific and technical personnel as well as in strategic planning. This can be expected to bear dividends for a SAP implementation project. The guidelines and manuals such as those on fisheries and marine productivity developed by the project can be expected to generate increasing coherence in approaches to data collection and analysis.  <br /><br />The project contracted a study on incentives (Paragraph 85)  for catalyzing changes in stakeholder behaviour which, while not fully developed, does identify areas that could be further investigated in a SAP implementation project.  A second study demonstrated the importance of GCLME to national economies in the region and established the rationale for continued investment in securing these benefits.  The waste stock management demonstration project has drawn attention to the economic case for reuse and recycling of waste products. <br /><br />Finally the project itself has acted as a champion for closer cooperation amongst Africa LMEs, and in May 2011 convened a meeting leading to the establishment of the Caucus of Large Marine Ecosystem Institutions and Programmes in West, Central and Southern Africa.<br /><br />Four of the five national demonstration projects were designed to address issues of wider relevance to the host country and to other GCLME countries, while the fifth, related to treatment of wastes at the phosphates factory in Togo, set out to address a very specific but regionally important pollution issue.  <br /><br />There have been and are ongoing efforts to disseminate the results and lessons of the demonstration projects.  <br />• The projects in Benin and Cameroon hosted regional dissemination workshops with participants from the other GCLME projects who were provided with frank feedback on the projects and had the opportunity to meet a cross-section of stakeholders involved in the project. The demonstration project coordinator has been invited to two other GCLME countries to share his experience with a wider group of national stakeholders as a result of the workshop.   <br />• A dissemination workshop is being considered for Côte d’Ivoire after the national validation workshop was completed. The question of  shoreline change is now being tackled by a wide range of national and regional initiatives and there is potential for sharing the lessons from the Côte d’Ivoire project  through related communities of practice.  <br />• The mangrove project in Nigeria is preparing a DVD on the lessons learned from the project, in view of the prevailing security situation in the project area that does not allow visits. In the meantime, as mentioned above (Paragraph 184), the project has generated a renewed interest in the country’s mangrove systems which are the most extensive in West Africa.  <br />• The results of all five demonstration projects were presented to the eighth PSC meeting and generated enthusiastic discussions.  <br /><br />The regional demonstration projects were not explicitly designed to be replicable in that they were to provide services at the regional level. Given the size, language differences, and practicalities of sharing samples, in the region, however, it would seem sensible in some cases to replicate services though a network of collaborating centres.  <br /><br />The rating on catalytic role and replication is satisfactory in view of the catalytic potential of the project, the replication efforts for the demonstration projects and the foundations that have been laid through the regional endorsement of the SAP and political commitments related to the GCLME.</p>",3,<p>IMC were established in all countries and have validated key project outputs such as NAPS.

A good example was presented to the TE mission in Ya’an city with the clear statement to replicate the concepts of IEM as developed by the project in other counties. This commitment derives from clear country ‘drivenness’ for the project demonstrating the importance of a well defined and accepted Project Document that has led to the increased co-financing and the higher likelihood that the achievements are sustained and further replicated. This validates the effort that is required to develop a detailed project document and all supporting information.<br /><br />• Strong Project Management Office: The PMO have effectively managed the technical delivery of this project as seen through the achievement of the outputs. The PMO has demonstrated good co-ordination of the many technical and non-technical partners and other stakeholders and in ensuring (through motivating the partners) that the work continued through alternative funding arrangements while the delays with the financial reporting were resolved. As with other successful project, the importance of a strong, dedicated and stable PMO/PMU has proven to be very important in driving this project and the importance of this to future projects is clear.<br /><br />• Project oversight: As with all GEF/UNEP projects a PSC is a mandatory requirement. This project has also benefited from Local Steering Committees (LSC) providing additional direction at the regional and local levels. The added benefit in this project has been the inter-ministerial or inter-department role of the members of the PSC/LSC thus further ensuring other sectors were involved in the decision making process. This had the benefit of effectively mainstreaming the important GEF objective of encouraging inter-ministerial involvement in the local operation of the project. The involvement of multiple ministries (or departments) at a local / regional level further assists the sustainability of the project’s activities as seen in the Boxing demonstration project and the activities in Ya’an. Encouraging further use of ‘LSCs’ to guide projects is seen as an innovative way to get this inter-ministerial routinely employed on projects.<br /><br />• Strong technical oversight: The role of the SAG in technical guidance of the PSC/LSC/PMO in the projects has also demonstrated value through recommendations on adjustments to the work programme and providing validation from the scientific community of the work undertaken on the assessments of ecosystem function. This input (from national and regional institutes) clearly provides additional confidence on the validity of the outputs and conclusions reached by the project further strengthening the likelihood of sustainability and replication. The concept of strong technical or scientific input to guide the project management should be further encouraged.<br /><br />• The ‘value’ of demonstration activities: The demonstration projects were well designed and (through the input of the SAG/PSC) adapted to ensure that they delivered clear ‘proof of concept’ of the IEM approach to both the local communities and the regional administrations. Involvement of local stakeholders at the design stage and throughout the evolution was key to the success of these activities. In addition the involvement of local administrations will not only ensure the likelihood of sustainability and replication of the intervention but gave further encouragement to the local population on the importance of the environment. Without this ‘poof’ the project would have been very technically focused and would have had little impact on the local population. This clear linkage between technical tools for ecosystem assessment and monitoring coupled with very practical applications of these can assist future projects by replication of the design concept.<br /><br />• Financial Reporting of Projects:  Financial management and reporting are essential elements of good and effective project management. The Yangtze project has managed its resources well but has not sufficiently responded to the expectations of the ProDoc on financial reporting (although the situation had improved towards the end of the project). Guidance is available from UNEP on financial issues, as well as appropriate training activities, as clearly demonstrated through other UNEP/GEF projects. The PMO could have alleviated some of the delays in the GEF funds disbursement by having a dedicated financial officer within the PMO who would have been familiar with the details of the project’s activities within all outcomes, understood FECO’s financial system and been able to respond to all UNDP/UNEP’s comments to the financial reports. Since the original design of the Project Document the financial management systems at FECO have evolved and they are currently dealing with many bilateral and multi-lateral donor projects in an efficient and effective manner. The experiences on financial management from this Project should be incorporated in any follow-on project leading to the adoption of direct financing by UNEP through FECO as the Executing Agency.<br /><br />• Overall the key lesson has been that all stakeholders in the project – from administrations to local farmers and villagers – understood the reasoning behind the project and saw early and direct benefits to their work / environment / economy as a result of the project’s activities</p>","<p>1. Reduction in nutrient loads to local soil and water bodies in project area: Installation of manure management systems, including construction of manure platforms, adequate manure storage facilities and training in optimum application of manure as fertilizers as well as implementation of environmentally friendly agricultural practices such as shrub and tree planting led to a significant decrease in nutrient loads entering soil and water bodies from agricultural sources.  <br />2.  Increased awareness of environmental issues among agro-processors and farmers: A broad nation-wide public awareness program of project benefits led to a significant increase in the percentage of farmers recognizing the importance of mainstreaming environmental considerations in agriculture and <br />implementing environmentally friendly agricultural practices.<br />3. Development of institutional and human capacity: Staff in relevant agencies/institutes such as the Soil Institute were  trained  in  good agricultural practices as well as  monitoring soil and water quality.  Capacity building among agricultural advisors will ensure dissemination of project benefits for years to <br />come and increased potential for large-scale replication of project activities.</p>","<p>Effective use of the methodologies and expert teams of the Yangtze Project has led to the initiation of the “Ecological Function Assessment and Monitoring in the Disaster Prone Areas&quot;. MEP started to compile the “Ecological Function Assessment and Supervision Management Plan at Disaster Prone Area”. The outputs from the project including the ecosystem function assessment and monitoring methodologies were utilized for the Management Plan. The Management plan will cover 2,058 counties at 29 provinces in China, including the counties where the small and mid size rivers with flood control requirement are more than 200 km2 in basin area, also the counties located at key river and suffered from the flood geographic hazards; It is noted that the ecological function monitoring methodologies including water resource retention and soil stabilization under the Monitoring for disaster prone zones are developed on the basis of the MEWS from the Yangtze Project. <br /><br />Sichuan Province Government are requiring other counties to replicate Baoxing IEM Models to other counties for ecological conservation purpose;<br /><br />At Baoxing, IEM concepts and approaches were mainstreamed into the county development plan and thematic plans for year 2011-2015</p>",III3,,III3,"<p>INDICATOR #1:  Policy framework for non-source pollution meeting EU criteria in place.

This is evident in  the adopted rules for decision making at the Commission, which operates a two-chambered voting arrangement requiring a majority by Pacific island countries to agree on matters of substance. A greater degree of coordination was required at national levels  between relevant government institutions dealing with fisheries management overall in aspects of law, compliance, science, economics and policy to bring the WCPFC into force and will  continue to be important for successful compliance with the Commission’s adopted conservation and management measures. An analysis of the participation at sub-regional WCPFC working group meetings would reflect the participation of representatives from relevant ministries in the efforts to ensure that legislation and policy allows Pac SIDS to met their international fisheries obligations</p>",III3,"<p>A critical precursor to improving fisheries management in the WCP was the establishment of a foundational governance institution.  Therefore, the OFMP put a high priority on supporting One of the most significant impacts of the OFMP was its contribution to the ongoing negotiations and eventual coming into force of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Convention (WCPF Convention) . This Convention signifies one of the first regional fisheries agreements to implement principles from the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement , i.e.,such as the application of the precautionary approach, that management decisions be based on the best available science, as well as ecosystem considerations and recognition of the special requirements of small island developing states (SIDS) (WCPFC brochure). The WCPF Convention is became considered the legal foundation for the management of fisheries for highly migratory fish species in the Western and Central Pacific. Negotiations for the convention began as far back as 1994, and with the final adoption and signature took taking place in Honolulu, Hawaii in 2000. However, advice and support provided under the OFMP project helped support the OFMP countries to take the necessary ensure that the necessary legal steps were taken for ratification and subsequent entry into force of the WCPF Convention in 2004.</p>",III3,"<p>INDICATOR#4 Newly established and/or strengthened (existing) transboundary waters institutions<br />All major fishing States have ratified WCPFC as at June 2006.

Indonesia has yet to achieve full membership.The project has supported WCPFC-related legal, policy and institutional reviews under way in many Pacific SIDS including national fishery status reports, legal reviews and reviews of management plans based on EAFM, and by regional scientific, legal, compliance and policy workshops and consultations.<br /><br />INDICATOR#5 Financial sustainability of joint transboundary waters institutions<br />The WCPFC currently operates a work programme with a budget of USD22 million. Its formula reflects that the burden of contributions for the management of migratory fish stocks are expected from those that fish.

They continue to meet annually collectively and in the sub-regional formation of Fisheries Ministers from countries that are Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA).

The Government of Georgia, as one of the most liberal economies in the region, has, over the past decade, reduced trade barriers and eased red tape to attract foreign direct investment. In 2006, Georgia was named the top reformer by the World Bank’s Doing Business Report because of a drastic reduction in business regulations. However, market liberalizations, while beneficial for the country as a whole, has had a more significant impact on rural subsistence farmers who compete with relatively cheap imports for basic foodstuffs. Given this environment, the project’s focus on extension services as a catalyst for increasing production was hampered by weak supply chains and relatively low producer prices. In addition, small farms that provide subsistence living may not have been the best poised to take advantage of technology and extension services for<br />export production.<br />Technology adoption rates are dependent on factors beyond the control of extension services that affect profitability of investments. The broader social and economic context presented a difficult environment for small farmers to boost production significantly. The weak supply chains and high margins at the retail level favor cheap agricultural imports from more advanced neighboring countries and result in low producer prices for small farmers. In such an environment, yield and production increases by small farmers do often not result in improved incomes. The project could have benefitted from a more clear linkage between markets, supply chains, and the purported increased production of the project areas.<br />Projects benefit from a clear set of objectives that relate closely to proposed activities. The ARET Project undoubtedly achieved a number of significant outcomes. However, the link between these outcomes and the objectives of the project remains underdeveloped. Project documents (such as Aide Memoires and ISRs) throughout implementation of the project frequently listed varying project objectives (at times to provide extension services to small farmers, at times to assist scientific researchers working in agricultural extension), and the activities under each of the components were not consistently linked to the ambitious overall objectives of the project. In addition, some objectives of the project (most notably the aim to improve production and increase farmer incomes) were mentioned in the PAD, but follow up, either through M&amp;E or through specific activities were assumed to occur. Thus, this project could have benefitted from strengthened links between the project objectives, the project activities, and the monitoring and evaluation. Close linkages between each of these typically provide improved focus to the project activities, as well as a clearer ability to assess outcomes and achievements of projects.<br />Broader social benefits are important to consider in cost-benefit analysis of technologies. In the context of Component 3, biogas digesters and manure pits were installed with the objective of reducing water pollution. The digesters were also expected to bring some monetary benefit to consumers in reduced costs for energy used for heating and cooking. From a cost standpoint, the manure pits were arguably more cost effective in achieving the objective of reducing water pollution, since the installation and maintenance costs of the pits are negligible. The costs of the biogas digesters, on the other hand, were in the range of US$2,000- US$2,500 (although during the project, the cost of the biogas digesters was subsidized by 80%). Despite the relative cost of installation, operation and maintenance, the biogas digesters proved to be much more popular because of the tangible economic benefit they brought to relatively poor households. As a result, the project shifted more resources to the installation of biogas digesters, and away from manure pits. These broader social benefits are not captured in the cost benefit analysis comparing the two technologies, yet projects aiming to introduce similar types of technologies would do well to examine the broader social context and demand for technologies, and allow for flexibility in shifting resources based on demand.<br />Prioritizing needs in the agriculture sector is best done around a core set of themes. The Competitive Grant Scheme was designed to provide grants based on a number of priority themes set forward by the Government of Georgia. However, the list of priority themes remained fairly long and comprehensive at the project start; nine priority areas were identified as being of particular importance to the agriculture sector, each with countless subsectors. One lesson that can be derived is that this list of priority areas remained too large, essentially funding any activity within agriculture. A more directed approach could be achieved with a more narrow set of priorities that defines the key areas for investment in the agriculture sector. By focusing the grant scheme around a smaller set of priorities, the investments made with the CGS could achieve a more targeted and comprehensive result.</p>",,,nav,,nap,,nap,,nav,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,-1,,-1,,nav,,

The GIWA project is one of a handful of nontraditional GEF projects commissioned by the GEF to provide insights and direction for the GEF programmes. As such, the project has several major points of departure from the more traditional types of GEF project. Foremost amongst these is the fact that the project was not “country-driven.” The audience and output was clearly intended to be the GEF itself, although this objective was seemingly lost during the course of the project execution, possibly as a result of the frequent staff changes within and without the project in its early days. Consequently, from the perspective of lessons learned, there are relatively few that can be gleaned from this project, and few that can be transferred to other, more traditional projects being conducted under the auspices of the GEF.<br />71. Notwithstanding, there are aspects of the GIWA programme that can illuminate approaches to future projects of this nature. These are summarised in the following paragraphs.<br />1. Staffing issues proved a major concern during the execution of the GIWA project. While many of the staffing-related concerns were beyond the control of the project team, the following observations are offered:<br />a. Continuity of Staffing: To the extent practicable, efforts should be made to avoid staff turnover during the project period, both from the point of view of<br />the IA and of the executing agency. Obviously, such issues are frequently beyond the control of these entities; however, it appears that, at one point in the process, a different staff member from the IA was attending each steering committee meeting, making it difficult to track concerns from meeting to meeting. Understandably, this reflected the availability of staff to fill in for the staff member lost during the initial transition, and the time needed to replace staff following such a transition.<br />b. Provision for Project Staffing: The “flip side” of the IA staffing issue is the issue of staffing the project. Granted, some of the early staff turnover appears to have been the result of “personality clashes” or issues of “corporate culture” that are difficult to anticipate. Notwithstanding, one lesson arising from this project is that adequate time should be provided in the work programme for staff to be acquired, and project teams assembled. The “lag time” involved in assembling the project team should be built into the project timeline, especially in cases where new staff are being sought for the conduct of a project. In this specific case, given that there were no counterpart governmental agencies involved in project execution that could provide interim and/or project staff, the time necessary for staffing the project led to a “late” start from which the project never recovered.<br />c. Use of Self-Selected Staff: Volunteers were an essential element of the GIWA project; whether they were local coordinators who received a stipend or meeting participants who received a per diem. The self-selection process limits the scope of participation to those individuals who have the time, interest, and ambition to participate in a project such as the GIWA. While the peer-review process ultimately endorsed this process by declaring the work products scientifically valid, it is possible that some data or insights were missed as a result—the majority of participants generally appeared to be younger scientists, although this was not the case across the board. Targeting specific [potential] contributors, and using these “names” to focus task teams may prove more efficient in future such endeavours. Notwithstanding, encouraging broad participation outside of those individuals who traditionally participate in international projects of this nature does promote diversity, generation of new ideas and approaches, and a broader cadre of individuals whose experience can be drawn upon in future projects—to an extent, the key participants in the GIWA project were individuals well-known to the UN system and who were familiar with the<br />status quo, a fact that perhaps prolonged the separation of marine and freshwater interests within the GIWA project. <br />2. Timing issues also plagued the project, almost from its inception. Some of these issues were also beyond the control of the project, but others perhaps could have been foreseen, as in the case of the absolute need to develop the GIWA methodology before it could be employed in the conduct of other elements of the<br />project. In future, where projects require the development of a methodology prior to other portions of the project being conducted, either the project should be divided into two phases, during the first of which the methodology can be developed and field tested, or there should be adequate time allowed for the application of trialand-error approaches to defining an appropriate methodology and allowing it to be field tested. The former would be preferable from a project management point of view, while the latter may be warranted from the strategic funding point of view.<br />3. Issue identification proved a challenge, especially when the issues facing most waters of the world, both fresh and saline, tend to be of a rather universal nature, especially given the scale of the transboundary waters, so highlighting one or two major challenges facing particular systems appeared trivial or ill-informed. This appearance, unquestionably, reflects the fact that the objective of the project was “lost;” rather than being a project to define potential areas for GEF interventions, the project sought to identify issues of concern to governments whose focus is national rather than regional in many cases. This wrinkle would reinforce the role of regional entities, whether Regional Seas Programmes or regional intergovernmental organisations, in bringing issues to the attention of groups of governments. Likewise, communicating these issues to governments proved to be a challenge for project teams comprised of water resources professionals. Notwithstanding, the GIWA products clearly identify roles of country governments individually as well as within their regional frameworks. In certain situations, both countries and regional organisations have utilised the GIWA outputs to formulated activities proposed for funding by the GEF (e.g., the Sao Francisco River Basin project of Brazil) or other multilateral organisations (e.g., the Mediterranean Regional Seas Programme).<br />4. Country-driven-ness, a key concept of the GEF, proved to be a necessary element in the allocation of personnel, funds, staff time, and resources. In those  areas of the world that are GEF-eligible, countries and individuals responded to the GIWA initiative with enthusiasm. Elsewhere—North America being the prime example, response to the GIWA was muted.<br />a. This issue really relates to the definition of the client: in this case, the client was the GEF itself, yet the GEF Secretariat played a minor role in project<br />development and management, much less of a role, in fact, than most client governments would do in the development and management of similar,<br />traditional IW projects. From hearsay evidence supplied during the evaluation mission, this lack of participation seems to have translated into a lack of support for the GIWA findings. This, of course, places the outcome of the project in some doubt, although the GEF Secretariat has endorsed and supports the use of the root cause and causal chain analyses in TDA-SAP IW projects.<br />b. A further issue is the transfer of the outputs to the relevant governments: UNEP, as the IA, should disseminate those completed printed report to the<br />respective governments riparian to the transboundary waters. This would encourage those governments to act upon these findings, either through existing Regional Seas initiatives in the case of the Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) or through national or multilateral action in other cases. Indeed, in a few cases, these transmittals may also encourage governments to seek GEF involvement, which could be guided by the issues identified in the GIWA reports. Again, completion of those documents in a final state of readiness but not published and those only published in web format would be encouraged and appropriate to facilitate transmission of those reports as well. Action by the target governments would then conform to the accepted and traditional GEF process.<br />72. In summary, of the lessons learned, the only real lessons that could have changed the outcome of the GIWA project would be: (i) the separation of the methodology development from the application of the methodology into two project phases, and (ii) the clearer definition of the client, and the more active involvement of the client—the GEF Council, Secretariat, and countries—in the conduct of the project. Such involvement should not have been so overt as to bias the execution of the project, but, on the other hand, it would have provided better direction to that execution so that the results better fitted the GEF’s needs. In the end, the project did produce a goodly number of scientifically accepted products— the remaining completed reports requiring publication, perhaps, by UNEP—as well as a workable methodology. The challenge now is to implement that methodology—which challenge is set to the GEF.</p>",,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,-1,,-1,,nap,,

However, a “unified project” also has certain disadvantages compared to the partnership framework approach (as in the case of the Black Sea/Danube), which allows for more flexibility in individual country programs (particularly appropriate when there is a high degree of heterogeneity across countries), greater ease of implementation within a country, and perhaps a higher degree of ownership by countries. <br />• Different riparian countries may require different approaches - Even when using the “unified project” model, it is important to recognize that there can be significant differences in culture, history, economics and politics across countries that necessitate different approaches to different beneficiary countries. For example, the incentives for farmers to implement nutrient management programs in EU member states can be very different from those in non-EU countries.<br />• Strong central coordination is necessary to ensure delivery of results in regional projects – Even when dealing with countries and institutions with good capacity, such as in this project, a dedicated, empowered project manager is still needed to coordinate activities across the various countries, components and local institutions.<br />• Limited GEF resources can still have a major impact - If the policy environment is conducive, and participants are committed, a great deal can be achieved with a relatively small financial allocation by leveraging local skills and resources and contributions from development partners.<br />• The implications of political-economic changes must be assessed, even for environmental projects - In this case, major political-economic shifts, such as four of five beneficiary countries joining the EU, 18 created both opportunities and challenges for implementation, and it is important to recognize such factors during design in order to effectively harness such forces. <br />• Implementation by existing institutions helped build ownership and provided for sustainability of the collaborative networks - The Project was fortunate to have a recognized, agreed-upon governing body such as HELCOM in place for protection of the marine environment in order to provide the institutional structure for implementation. For Component 1, working with ICES was a major advantage. For Component 2, working with existing extension services has aided mainstreaming.<br />• When applying the LME approach, a great deal of effort is necessary if links are to be created between land and sea components - In the Project, one way that was discovered to do this was by using monitoring of nutrient flows into the watershed, and the subsequent impact on the marine environment.

Significant outcomes included strengthened cooperation between the riparian countries and between the three international agencies, and national dissemination activities. However, dissemination was modest (and needs to be continued) and socioeconomic assessments, such as the valuation of ecological goods and services, remain to be done.

The Project achieved these objectives to a significant extent through financing pilot demonstrations, training, raising local stakeholder interest, and through establishing a network of technical specialists, which includes approximately 30 individuals from 12 institutions (academic, educational and NGOs) in the four Component 2 beneficiary countries. The LIU network functions have been mainstreamed into national programs and several regional initiatives of HELCOM (including the BSAP) and the EU, establishing an international platform for continuation of efforts to control non-point source pollution across the region. Specific achievements included: awareness building; training of farmers and advisory service staff; establishment of the AgECS, in collaboration with NEFCO; 20:1 leveraging of GEF funds to provide investment credit for 20 pilot farms; catalyzing investments on a further 50 farms outside the project (farms are typically large private farms with 50 to several hundred head of livestock); automatic monitoring of water quality (especially nutrients) in selected watersheds, together with modeling, to measure the impact of on-farm investments; restoration of grasslands and/or wetlands in four countries, together with training and equipment; development of a pilot ecotourism plan; and, establishment of a Baltic Sea Agri- Environmental Network.</p>"

This precedent should be appreciated and further developed in practice.<br /><br /><br />Continuity in terms of time and people involved in the project should be secured as much as possible during both the formulation and implementation of the project. Although the commitment to the project was made by organisations, and not individuals, the change of personnel was not helpful to the project, also because the Project Document does not contain elaborated partner agreements. Project continuity and the team spirit also did not benefit from the regular changes in the Steering Committee and in the management of some governmental departments and sectors during the project execution.<br />In complex projects, where various organisations and various disciplines join to achieve common goals, the agreements on the roles, responsibilities and ownership of the future partners need to be included in a project document. That would substantially speed up elaboration of the project tasks and the actual commence of the project. Definition and assignment of the EDP project tasks (described in the Inception Report) took more of six moths, mostly due to intensive negotiation among the project partners.<br />Management of the project through a task-based, deliverable-oriented grant distribution appears to be far more efficient that the lump-sum payment procedure. In this project a „delivery-based management‟ is introduced, applying payment upon completion of the project tasks. Also for that reason, the project tasks need to be clearly elaborated in the Inception Report.<br />Feasibility of possible additional, unplanned and unbudgeted, project activities should be carefully examined in terms of required resources. In this project, a recommendation of the Mid-Term Evaluation to embark on a socio-economic and policy aspect of the project was followed. Although some success has been achieved such as the formation of local user associations, a production of a development Action Program was obviously too ambitious. Moreover, this additional activity was coupled with a regular project activity (Environmental Impact Assessment), putting an extra burden on the project. Any additional activity.<br />Non-technical activities required to contribute to the achievement of a long-term development objective also need to be specified and budgeted in the project document. In the Eastern Desert Project, a development aspect of the problem is used merely as a framework for the research, technical objective, without any elaboration of development related activities. Nevertheless, the realisation of the EDP technical objectives certainly contributed to achievement of the EDP development objective that is to develop of non-conventional water resources in Egypt.<br />The Eastern Desert Project makes a unique example of the development of the equal project partnership between Cairo University and the governmental departments/institutes. This precedent should be appreciated and further developed in practice. Assigning a leadership of the project to Cairo University was instrumental to this positive development. In principle, the affiliation of the project manager should not be important as long as the project objectives and the personal skills are used as the main criterion for the selection. The Eastern Desert Project is targeted, applied, technical research project and the selection of a PM from Cairo University was a logical choice. If the realisation of the project development objective was elaborated through a set of budgeted activities, the positioning of the PM role within a governmental department or institute might have been more appropriate. Another option could be, if in accordance with UNDP regulations, to appoint two Principal Investigators (PI) who would work under UNDP authority.</p>","<p>1.

<p>The main fisheries in the Wider Caribbean Region were considered to be associated to 3 key ecosystem types:</p>
<ul class=""simple"">
<li>Reef Ecosystems (incl. mangroves &amp; seagrasses)</li>
<li>Pelagic Ecosystems</li>
<li>Continental Shelf Ecosystems</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequently, and with the aim of implementing an Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM) approach, the updating of the TDAs was conducted at the level of each one of these key ecosystems.</p>
<p>The ecosystem-based TDAs were then further complemented by the overarching &quot;&quot;Governance Framework&quot;&quot; and summarizing &quot;&quot;Regional&quot;&quot; TDAs.</p>
<p>The TDAs included the development of Causal Chain Analyses (CCAs), which clearly visualize the linkage between problems and their direct, intermediate and root causes.</p>
<p>The CCAs constitute highly valuable aids in the identification of the priority measures (policy, legal &amp; institutional reforms, management options &amp; investments) that are needed to ensure the sustainable provision of goods &amp; services from the shared Living Marine Resources in the CLME.</p>
<p>As such, the TDAs and CCAs are the outcomes from a technical-scientific process, and constitute the basis for the political process of defining and agreeing upon priority actions for a healthy Large Marine Ecosystem (through the development and adoption by all countries of a Strategic Action Programme or SAP), that support sustainable development in the Wider Caribbean Region.&quot;</p>
",IW4,"<p>&quot;10-year “Strategic Action Programme for the Sustainable Management of the shared Living Marine Resources of the Caribbean and North Brazil Shelf Large Marine Ecosystems” (“the CLME+ SAP”) endorsed by CLME countries, June 2013.</p>
<p>The Action Programme, which sets forward regional strategies and actions to deal with critical threats to the marine environment such as unsustainable fisheries, habitat degradation, pollution and climate change, was developed under a 4-year project called “CLME”.</p>
<p>he Action Programme (SAP) provides countries, regional organizations, civil society and development partners with a comprehensive roadmap for resolving critical issues affecting living marine resources. The SAP combines actions for structural change and capacity building at the regional, sub-regional and national levels, with high priority management interventions and investments on the ground, and is expected to catalyze actions and investments worth well over US$ 100 million in the Caribbean and North Brazil Shelf Large Marine Ecosystems over the next 5 to 10 years.  Special attention will be given to actions that further allow for more sustainable fisheries and for the protection of key marine habitats (e.g. through the strengthening of the networks of marine protected areas).&quot;</p>

However, these legal instruments are not explicit regarding how to develop the institutional decentralization of basin management through basin committees and agencies. The experience gained in the SFRB project is singular in this respect (see main<br />aspects in annex B) and provides a useful model or example for other countries to construct similar mechanisms. Institutional arrangements are always unique due to the combination of legal, social and economical circumstances but the successes and failures of the Brazilian development process constitute a major asset for development of similar arrangements elsewhere.<br />• The public participation processes for the development of a Strategic Action Programme provided very good experience in decentralization and stakeholder participation. The development of basin committee was based on (a) workshops in different places of the basin; (b) important commitment of the Federal and State authorities; (c) representative NGOs, research, educational and private institutions and public.<br />• It is recommended that in the future development of the program the human water sustainability in the semi arid sub-basin should be addressed by the project.</p>",,,nav,,nap,,nap,,nav,,IW4,"<p>The DAB Diagnostic Analysis of the São Francisco River Basin and Coastal Zone was initiated in January 2000 and presented a causal chain of the problems and the specification of remedial actions.<br />The DAB preceded the PAE – the Strategic Action Program for Integrated Management of the Basin and Coastal Zone – and was presented in a published report (Brasil, 2003).<br />The DAB was prepared based on 28 sub-projects developed in the period referred to above.

To achieve this it is necessary to make the wetland system (including the social, economic and ecological components) resilient to any future change. This means making sure that the system is capable of adapting. Ecosystem “resilience can be defined as the capacity of a system to undergo disturbance while maintaining both its existing functions and controls and its capacity for future change” (Gunderson 2000).<br /><br />Lesson 2:GEF demonstration projects should have, in addition to the Project Manager, a Monitoring Officer. Adaptive management is a phrase that is used in almost every GEF project but with little attention to what it actually means. Adaptive management or experimental management requires a level of scientific rigor in designing the intervention, identifying the assumptions, defining what success might look like (the objectives) and a statistically robust monitoring system (that might include comparisons and a control). Adaptive management is essentially a means to allow management to proceed without the need for extensive research. Within any GEF project there are two levels of adaptive management: that of monitoring the performance and impact of the project (essentially the role of the EA, PMU and Project Manager which is already covered in the project cycle management) and also to ensure that specific interventions are achieving what was expected of them, the latter being the role of a monitoring officer.</p>",,"<p>The rating for “Catalytic Role and Replication”:  this issue is considered to be “Satisfactory”for the<br />following reasons:<br />- The Project has instigated a number of behavioral changes amongst stakeholders, developed<br />incentives by linking ecosystem processes to economic activities, developed a number of<br />regulatory instruments, improved the financial position SIW protected areas and provided a<br />significant champion for wetland conservation in Zhongshan University</p>",3,,IV0,,IV0,,nav,,4,,2,,nap,,1,,4,,100,<p>7/7 countries</p>,43,<p>3/7 countries</p>,3,,

The project has improved the management of the area, from zero management to a situation where there are management plans, a multi-sectoral management group, increased support for management plan, and increased capacity for monitoring and reporting.  Effective management, however, implies continuous efforts in the enforcement of the measures approved, the monitoring of the threat (reduction) and/or the impact of the intervention on the status of the resource (for adaptive management), and sustainable financing to support management activities.  At least another 3 years will be needed for the management plan to be fully implemented. <br /><br />• Scientific evidence can not only support management actions, but also be used to enhance community awareness – Good scientific data and information and the involvement of scientists from IIS/LIPI underpinned the spatial planning, site-selection, public-awareness campaign, and governance. The importance of scientific information goes beyond the provision of rationale for management. The knowledge that community people have gained from the booklet summarising the surveys’ results shared by staff of LIPI was acknowledged as the most important contribution of the project (village forum in April 2012).  Community members take pride in the diversity of seagrass species they have, extent of seagrass beds, and the importance of this natural resource in coastal fisheries as well in the life-cycle of threatened species. Change in behaviour of fishermen was reported, and the occurrence of blast-fishing has decreased.  <br /><br />• Effective communication between the IA/Fund Management Officer and EA/PIU is of utmost importance – Any communication/request on cash advances need to responded to promptly. It is important that financial procedures, including schedules for disbursement, are clear at the inception of the project. Delays in disbursement pose risks in the implementation of activities and ultimately the outcome(s) of a project. A contingency fund (per disbursement) may cushion these impacts.</p>",,"<p>There is strong support from the villagers and from government agencies that will likely sustain the management of seagrass meadows in East Bintan. The management regulations emanate from national laws and they are supported by District Officials. The National Government and the District Government of Bintan have allocated some amount for supporting the seagrass sanctuaries (e.g., for markers, buoys, monitoring parameters in the sanctuaries with partners).

Participatory implementation. Participatory approaches to wetland restoration design were critical for Project success, which hinged on changing people’s perceptions of wetlands, and gaining the full support for restoration among authorities and stakeholders. PA Local Consultative Councils and public awareness campaigns effectively supported stakeholder involvement. The established panel of experts was instrumental in providing independent assessments that balanced the best interests of local stakeholders and Government. Skepticism about wetland restoration among stakeholders transformed into strong support through their early involvement in planning and decision making processes. The KBPS adopted innovative management arrangements—a group of diverse stakeholders was formalized into a management team, resulting in strong local commitment to the Project. For community-level investments that affect multiple local interests, the participatory approach establishes strong Project ownership and effective cooperation among local stakeholders. However, participation lengthens implementation time—sometimes one to two years— and the participatory approach requires more focused public awareness activities. In hindsight, the project should have included a comprehensive and professional Public Awareness Campaign.<br />2. Small grant programs. Linking Small Grants and Farmer Transition Support Programs to the broader objective of wetlands restoration was highly beneficial to local communities to ensure: (i) commitment to common goals; engagement with the main restoration activity and (ii) raising public awareness of environmental and conservation issues. If well targeted and managed, the community-level grant programs financing local initiatives on the ground can be effective to engage diverse local stakeholders (communities, farmers, etc.) with the main Project activity and to foster stronger public commitment to the Project objectives.<br />3. Wetland restoration and Project benefits. The Project region had lost over 80 percent of its floodplains and wetlands and restoring these is a significant environmental achievement. This Project focused on wetlands potential to reduce nutrient loads; however, the wider environmental benefits, especially for conservation of biodiversity and reproduction of bio-resources such as fish and birds, have produced additional benefits. The Project achieved more than wetlands restoration, it also improved PA management beyond the restored sites and implemented programs to help farmers reduce adverse environmental impacts from agricultural activities. Farmers adopted measures consistent with Best Agricultural Practices, which could further reduce nutrient releases, and other beneficiaries applied for similar projects funded by the EU and national programs.<br />4. Monitoring and Evaluation. A full assessment of environmental improvements, following restoration of habitats such as wetlands, often requires more time than the Project implementation period. As wetlands restoration was completed only towards the end of the Project, sufficient detailed monitoring to provide indisputable evidence of nutrient reduction was not available during project implementation. Preliminary PNP data revealed substantially increased fish and bird breeding two months after the first flooding, but several years of data would be necessary to confirm results for nutrient retention/reduction. Therefore, it is important that the Recipient commits to continue monitoring Project impacts for 10-15 years so future projects can benefit from useful data on wetland restoration effects. One of the main lessons learned is that for future similar projects an achievable realistic framework is provided to allow for the longer-term effects of restoration.<br />5. Bank supervision impact. The Project MTR was critical to help the Recipient resolve implementation issues on finalizing restoration design and initiating construction works. Bulgarian country office staff provided proactive and close supervision through daily interaction with counterparts and this was essential to the turnaround in Project performance, overcoming initial delays, and implementing key Project activities in full. The Bank team skills mix helped establish effective Project dialogue and close working relationships with beneficiaries, which enabled the Recipient to maintain focus on development objectives, mobilize additional resources, and successfully complete the Project.</p>","<p>1. The project piloted restoration of 4035 ha of former marshes (double the original target) in two protected areas and brought under improvement management and protection 27 700 ha with globally significant biodiversity habitats.<br />2. Fifty-five small grant projects have been successfully implemented on the two project sites under the “Small Grant Program for  Biodiversity Conservation”. The projects were targeted at raising public awareness of biodiversity conservation mainly among young people. The execution of the program involved 23 NGOs, about 65 leading experts, nearly 5500 students and about 250 children from kindergartens.<br />3. The project introduced a new idea and brought to a turnaround in perceptions – wetlands are now seen not only as a beautiful wildlife habitat, but also as contributing to sustainable development and economic growth. They bring environmental and economic benefits, and act as a buffer against floods.</p>",,nav,,nap,,nap,,nav,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,-1,,-1,,nap,,

Even if the termination of the project has left CEHI momentarily weaker from a financial and HR standpoint, it has endeared itself to several partners and environmental practitioners as a competent organization capable of delivering technical quality.<br /><br />Readiness Criteria - New IWCAM related initiatives in the region could consider developing a set of  “readiness criteria” for future projects. These could include: <br />• Establishing preconditions<br />• Defining the enabling environment required for the project to be successful (e.g. countries which have ratified the LBS protocol)<br />• Insisting on the need for countries to have some policy in place and required legisla-tion<br /><br />Capacity building and sustainability – These are closely linked and should be es-sential features of all enabling projects like IWCAM. The issue of capacity is one which most SIDS will face when it comes to implementation of projects. Once a project is draw-ing to an end, every effort should be made to ensure that trained personnel are absorbed in positions in which their skills will be effectively utilized.  This will require that both the implementing agencies as well as the PCU ensure transparency in the selection process and that the best candidates are selected. Some of the more obvious benefits of IWCAM were related to the personal growth of individuals involved with the project, particularly at the community level.  The emergence of the NGO group in St. Lucia is evi-dence of that personal and collective growth.  <br /><br />Adaptive management - Adaptive and flexible management should be encour-aged.  This is especially relevant when engaging local communities.  One of the first ini-tiatives of the St. Lucia Demonstration project was a needs assessment.  Out of that came initiatives to address the pollution of the river in the community and innovative measures such as the Rain Water Harvest (RWH) system for collecting and storing water.<br /><br />M&amp;E - Monitoring and evaluation can take several forms, preparation of annual workplans, quarterly and annual reports, mid-term and terminal reviews.  It is essential, however, that provisions are made for projects to obtain feedback, not just on their per-formance, but also, on the extent to which stakeholders, and to some extent, the wider public, are receiving “the message” and how that message is making a difference in their lives.<br /><br />Private sector - Several initiatives pursued under the GEF-IWCAM project seemed to have great potential for private sector involvement and even being of commercial value.  While this may not have been a specified output, with the context of current ef-forts to promote the green economy principles, a greater effort should be made in pro-moting these initiatives.  This may require the engagement of short-term consultants to explore the commercial values of such initiatives and developing a blueprint for its commercialization.<br /><br />Using ICT - While exchange visits and workshops have great value for participants the changing landscape for convening meetings using electronic means need to be explored and considered and much more use made of this technology.  The savings in terms of travel and accommodation could be tremendous as funds diverted from travel could be used for the benefits of demonstration projects or other beneficial uses.<br /><br />Communication activities - Another of the major successes of the GEF-IWCAM project was the quantum of resource materials, including the high quality newsletter “Caribbean Water Ways” published on a quarterly basis.  This was an initiative of the PCU because the budget did not initially make allowance for communications of this nature.  This obviously was an oversight, but serves to indicate the importance of ensuring that communications is a part of every major project, taking into consideration the various audiences (project managers, partners, students and academic institutions) who will have an interest in the information to be disseminated. The website proved to be a very valuable means of communications.  However, having an informed and interactive website requires maintenance (regular updates) to ensure its effectiveness.  Like in IWCAM, adequate resources should be made available in all projects for the regular maintenance of the site.<br /><br />Political Legitimacy within CARICOM - While UNEP CAR-RCU and UNDP provided valuable support to the programme, and CEHI was one of the EA, the sustainability of such initiatives will be greatly enhanced if there would be greater visibility of the re-gional presence and their participation directly related to programmes approved by the regional political governing body.  The adoption of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas (RToC) provides an opportunity for such linkages (within CARICOM) in a similar manner to linkages with Cartagena Convention, the GPA, Barbados Programme of Action (BPoA) and the St. Georges Declaration. The justification for such an approach is that the RToC is a legally binding document which creates obligations on parties (CARICOM Member States) that are signatory to the Treaty to enforce.  The output, therefore, which required or may in the future require the drafting or amendment to legislation will have their roots, not only in principles of sustainable development and sound environmental management, but also in obligations derived from the treaty and not necessarily from an arbitrary requirement of the project.  <br /><br />Involvement of the Scientific Community- Though there is evidence of the in-volvement of the academic community on specific projects, there was little evidence of attempts to engage them, particularly the scientific community, on a sustained basis.  It could have been beneficial to have some technocrats from outside the governmental (national and regional) circles on R-TAG.<br /><br />From Policies to Laws - Given the fact that policies take an estimated two to three years, or more in some cases, to translate into legislation, and given the fact that several countries have demonstrated such great willingness to adopt the reforms and policies (policies adopted and institutional arrangements reconfigured) which the project sought to promote, GEF-UNDP-UNEP may want to consider providing continued support for the implementation to those policies either directly through the existing executing agency arrangement (CAR-RCU and CEHI) or through another ongoing project (CReW), utilizing any unused funds.  That support may require support for raising awareness at the community level (NGO support), the drafting of appropriate legislation and develop-ing a system of monitoring and reporting on progress specific to the projects executed under the project</p>","<p>1. Entry into force of the Protocol Concerning Pollution of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean from Land-Based Sources and Activities (LBS Protocol) in 2010, following its ratification by the Bahamas (and prior ratification by Antigua &amp; Barbuda, as well as significant progress towards ratification and/or the meeting of its objectives by several other Participating Countries).<br />2. Treating of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater (BOD, N and P) through  installation of 4 domestic and 1 industrial constructed wetlands (2000m3 of untreated effluent diverted from waterways); Saving 16,000 m3 of potable water through installment of 31 rainwater harvesting techniques.<br />3. Significant stakeholder involvement,  including  government and local communities, and ongoing community engagement and mobilization.  This is evidenced by the establishment of committees which will continue to function after the Project (e.g. Cuba, St. Lucia, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic) and ongoing use of the Community Based Resource Assessment tool, developed by the Project.</p>","<p>The project has triggered spontaneous replication and in some cases has induced cata-lytic impacts. This has occurred thanks to the combined effect of regional support mech-anisms (targeted capacity building, institutional strengthening, policy guidance, and dis-semination of information and experiences) and most importantly local on the ground actions (demonstrations and pilots) that involved at various levels all participating countries. The region is now in what will approximates the “Intermediate State” of ROtI (replication, adherence to regional treaties), and is moving towards showing concrete impacts (enacting IWCAM reforms).  <br /><br />At the regional level, the main catalytic achievement – albeit not entirely attributable to the project - has been the entry into force of the LBS Protocol. The project has also cata-lysed the commitment of the regional Executing Agencies to sustain IWCAM promotion action as part of their mandates, and maintain and sustaining the CHM. In the countries, various cases of replication have been detected during the evaluation (see Annex I). Among those worth mentioning here is the effective exchange and replication going on in Tobago, Grenada and St. Lucia.  A number of results in countries can be categorized as “catalytic”, mostly in the domain of creation/adoption of the new management water-shed/coastal zone schemes, as for example in the case of St. Lucia, the Dominican Re-public, or Bahamas, Exuma. New water and/or sewerage management policies have been adopted or are in the process of adoption in some countries (e.g.: Jamaica, St Kitts), and an innovative Land and Sea Use Plan is being considered for adoption and application to islands of The Bahamas. There is evidence in Saint Lucia, that a Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) policy promoted by the project was introduced for all Health Centers following the passage of Hurricane Tomas amid the evidence that these systems made a huge difference in having water available to those institutions which had installed the system prior to the passage of the Hurricane.<br /><br />In the opinion of the evaluators the most important factor behind these country level ac-complishments is the strong commitment of the national executing agencies (see Section 3), and local demo or pilot managers, who often became the champions of the IWCAM approach in their country, and beyond (see the case of Jamaica). Two general lessons relevant for the enhancement of catalytic impacts and replication can be drawn from this experience: (i) selection of demonstration projects that are highly relevant in the national context (this was made possible by the extended ad hoc preparation process during PDF B); (ii) involvement of the right national entities in the direct execution of demo projects, together with backstopping from a strong regional PCU. <br /><br />One further relevant consideration related to the project’s catalytic role, relates to the involvement of development financial institutions such as the World Bank, IADB, CDB and others during the project lifetime. This involvement was called for repeatedly in the Project Document, with the intent of catalysing the interest of these institutions, includ-ing IWCAM related issues, in their dialogues with the countries to provide support in addressing coastal environmental sustainability concerns. This involvement by the in-vestment banks did not happen in a systematic way, but only sporadically, and only as part of demo execution. The reason for this lack of project’s action can in part be due to the fact that the Project Document, while calling for IFIs involvement, did not foresee any specific activities and outputs apart from generically calling for the establishment of a Partnership Forum. Other elements that discouraged the project management in mov-ing aggressively and systematically in this direction would certainly been the cancella-tion of the large IADB loans, which formed the bulk of the project’s co-financing, and the length of time between approval and implementation of the GEF funded Caribbean Re-gional Fund for Wastewater Management (CReW) investment project to be implemented by IADB and UNEP.  <br /><br />These considerations only partly justify the lack of project delivery on this point.  A simi-lar consideration can be made for what concerns the engagement of the private sector, which was sporadic and happened exclusively in connection with the demos (Bahamas Exuma, Dominican Republic). The tourism and cruise industry reportedly did not re-spond to, albeit limited, efforts made to engage their interest in the project.</p>",nav,,IW3,"<p>1.

Developing a detailed operational strategy among five countries is a daunting effort under any circumstances, but even more so when there are assymetrics in power, wealth and political systems between countries. Thus, spending substantial resources to develop a detailed strategy may be wasteful. Also large-scale TA projects or stand-alone components with broad objectives like A-1 studies are difficult to implement due to often divergent opinions about how they should be undertaken. <br />2. Multi-donor projects are extremely difficult to implement. This is a lesson in particular for GEF operations, where GEF policy places great emphasis on the need for substantial co-financing.<br />3. Inadequate preparation of some components before appraisal adds greatly to the burden of the project agency and Bank supervision staff during implementation.<br />4. GEF support can have a catalytic role, as evidenced by the impressive number of parallel and spin-off projects generated, at least partly from WEMP. Among these was a decision by Uzbekistan to expand wetlands restoration with its own funds, investments under the Bank-supported Uzbekistan Drainage, Irrigation and Wetlands Improvement project, and the Kazakhstan SYNAS projects.<br />5. PMCU was given responsibility for implementing activities which would have more appropriately been implemented by country-level line agencies. The project activities and components, such as component C, D and E could have been implemented by the countries' Ministries of Agriculture/Environment or National Hydromet. This would have enhanced country ownership, and resulted in strengthening national institutions, improving sustainability.<br />6. Regarding strategic analysis, allocating substantial resources to ambitious regional studies may not be a good use of resources. A better alternative is likely to be to agreed on broad principles, and then to concentrate on more narrowly focused follow-up work in areas like energy-irrigation trade-offs and the impact of glacier melting, and above all, in improved irrigation and drainage management at the country level. It is clear that poor national water management and degraded infrastructure cause many of the environmental problems in the Aral Sea Basin. WEMP activities in dam safety, trans-boundary monitoring and wetlands restoration will be best followed up through national programs, now that the project has put the spotlight on these issues and they are seen as priorities on the countries’ agendas.<br />7. The project validated an underlying assumption of the ASBP: While restoring the Aral Sea to its former size and productivity will not be possible, it is feasible to recreate much of the lost value by restoring wetlands in the deltas of the Amu and Syr Darya Rivers. This was determined by the successful restoration of Lake Sudoche under Component E and by the analyses of Component A-1, which conclude that additional water of suitable quality can be made available to the deltas by improving water management throughout the basin. These lessons have been incorporated in the Bank's Syr Darya and Northern Aral Sea Project in Kazakhstan and the Uzbekistan Drainage, Irrigation and Wetlands Improvement Project.<br />8. Regional projects are generally complex and difficult to implement. Also, providing counterpart funds for regional projects is even more difficult than for the national projects. This is especially true in Central Asia where much of the existing infrastructure now crosses borders and the governments are cash strapped. However, programs conceptualized at the regional level can be successfully implemented when specific activities are defined and implemented nationally. This was confirmed by WEMP experience with the relatively trouble-free implementation of Components C, D and E, and national projects such as the Syr Darya Northern Aral Sea Control project in Kazakhstan, and the Water Supply and Sanitation projects in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. A better approach would be to design programs for the regional level but divide projects and activities into efforts at the national level; this will make them consistent with regional goals and coordination, but place implementation under national governments. This lesson is reflected in the design of the proposed Ferghana Valley Water Resources Management Program and should be a principle of ASBP II.<br />9. Instead of the whole Aral Sea Basin, a river basin approach which deals with the Syr Darya and Amu Darya basins separately is increasingly being used in dealing with regional water management issues. The Aral Sea itself has been separated into two parts. The Northern Aral Sea and delta depend upon the flows of Syr Darya, and the Large Aral Sea and delta depend on the Amu Darya waters. The number of countries involved in each basin is reduced to about three, making discussions and cooperation more practical. Also, the issues of water management in Syr Darya Basin are more severe and the implementation of solutions more advanced than the Amu Darya.<br />10. Another difficulty with regional projects is that country ownership at the line ministry level is a challenge. For example, because the project was prepared largely by EC-IFAS, ICWC, and other regional water experts, along with the donors, the line ministries had only limited participation in preparing the operation and there was relatively little focus on country specific results. Ministries of Economy and Finance have had even less involvement. The lesson is that it may be unrealistic to expect full country ownership from all major line and core ministries for a US$20 million regional project. A less ambitious approach may be more likely to succeed.<br />11. A further lesson well documented in projects from other countries is that entrusting project management to a PMCU of relatively well paid contracted staff, while it may ensure that Bank procedures are followed, does not build ownership at country level. On the contrary, it may lead to resentment from technical ministries.</p>",,,nav,,IWA,"<p>(c) Improve the management of international waters: the strategic studies supported under WEMP demonstrated that the principal water management problems of the basin are not due to management and allocation tensions at regional level. They are due to deteriorating irrigation and drainage infrastructure and poor water management at national level, principally within the two countries which comprise 75% of water use within the basin, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Furthermore, when there have been transboundary difficulties, these have generally been at a bilateral or sub-basin level. The Central Asian Countries' focus during the project period shifted from the Sea to the upper river basins and from regional to national issues. In the Syr Darya basin, the energy-irrigation uses emerged as major issues and the countries made several agreements to address them. In the Amu Darya basin, energy-irrigation issues were<br />less severe. While bilateral disputes over water have continued between some of the basin states, they have not erupted into actual conflicts. Cooperation among these states is comparable to that in other river basins in the world. The IFAS/ICWC (International Fund for Aral Sea/Interstate Commission for Water Coordination) mechanism and the project activities, which encouraged information sharing and common solutions, can take some credit for this.<br />A bilateral agreement between Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan in 1996 clarified the sharing arrangements of Amu Darya waters downstream of Kerki, and has mostly worked without major dispute, although water shortages during the drought years have severely affected Karakalpakstan. The primary purpose of the<br />1996 agreement was to specify conditions for management of the irrigation and drainage facilities crossing the territories of the two countries and to define mechanisms for resolving problems. Issues related to major investments for rehabilitating the Karshi Pumping Cascade, crossing the two countries, remained<br />unresolved. The project provided the technical and analytical bases for improving water resources management and allocations among riparian states and sectors. Awareness of dam safety was introduced, which led to new investments to improve overall water management in the basin. Better records of water flows will be available for planning water resources, as well monitoring and management. Wetlands restoration provided a practical model for addressing the environmental degradation problems around the Aral Sea. These physical models of improved water management are being widely replicated in the basin. Thus in terms of physical outcomes and their sustainability, this project may be rated satisfactory.</p>",IWA,"<p>Build the capacity of regional institutions: The WEMP, and the ASBP more broadly, have not been successful in achieving this objective. At the time of appraisal both EC-IFAS the regional body for coordinating the ASBP, and the project management unit of the WEMP, were in Tashkent. Senior Uzbek experts played a key role in both, and experts from other countries played a lesser role; but, EC-IFAS was designed with a rotating presidency. In 1999 this was moved to Ashgabat while the PMU and most expertise remained in Tashkent. EC-IFAS was greatly weakened. Furthermore, support to EC-IFAS by UNDP and EU-TACIS ceased in 2000. In 2002 the presidency was moved to Dushanbe and under Tajik leadership, EC-IFAS has revived its coordination and advocacy role. However, Uzbek and Turkmen support has been limited, and the donor support to EC-IFAS is much more limited than in the late 90s.</p>",nav,,IW1,,IW1,,nav,,nav,,nav,,0,,0,,nav,,

During these dialogues, national agency personnel exchanged information and knowledge with water management institutions and GEF projects managers. Access to IWRM best practices was made feasible thanks to the document entitled “Pilot Virtual Library of Best Practice in Water Management,” which has been prepared for publication.<br /><br />INDICATOR#5 (Strengthened collaboration amongst riparian countries leading to improved water resources management) <br />A Common Strategy for Integrated Water Resources Management in LAC was discussed and approved within the framework of the Gov. Focal Point meeting.</p>",nap,,IWA,"<p>INDICATOR#3 (Integrated Watershed Management Program Implementation)<br />As a result of the enhanced access to LAC water policy best practices Peru, Colombia and Argentina have all altered their water laws, and Argentina has undertaken a program of consultation with the provinces on water use.</p>",nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,nap,,-1,,-1,,nav,,"<p>INDICATOR#1 (Development of Information and Communication Tools)<br />A major part of the project was focused on developing specific processes for sharing and disseminating experiences and lessons learned, and therefore focused its efforts on the development of new Information and Communication Tools (ICT) and a new Web-based Information System for the IWRN. The Information System is based on (1) a dynamic and decentralized “web” of websites (2) mixed-partnerships for the operation of the websites and (3) basin-based information systems. It allows for a distributed management of the information, fostering a broader participation and the sharing of responsibilities. <br /><br />INDICATOR#2 (Creation of linked sub-regional nodes across Latin America)<br />The Information System is composed of a series of linked sub-regional nodes that include (1) the Southern Cone, hosted in Argentina and serving Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay, (2) the Brazilian Node, hosted in Brazil and serving only Brazil, (3) the Pacific Node, hosted in Peru and serving Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, and Venezuela, (4) the Central American Node, hosted in Costa Rica and serving all of the Central American countries, and (5) the Caribbean Node, hosted in Saint  Lucia and serving the Caribbean, as well as Guyana and Belize, both English-speaking countries. There is also a central node located in Florida, but it will soon be transferred to Motevideo at the new Secretariat of IWRN. An interface between the regional nodes has been developed to allow queries and dynamic navigation throughout the network.  The Southern Cone and the Brazilian Node have been especially active in their respective service areas.</p>"

Establishment of the institutional and structures at  locality and community levels for watershed management. Products such as Community Action Programs (CAPs) and Participatory Land Use Plans (PLUPs) have been prepared and are operational.<br />3. Capacity development through training and skills upgrade (two training sessions have been provided so far in the fundamentals of survey and hydrographic training from January 9-19, 2011 and March 26 to April 4, 2011, respectively. Participants for the survey training were from Sudan (4#), High Aswam Dam Authority HADA (1#), NRI (#1) and Nile Water Sector NWS (2#), while those for the hydrographic training from March 26 to April 4, 2011 were attended by 23 <br />participants including seven (7#) from HADA, one (10 from NRI, two (2#) from NWS and four (4#) from Sudan. A number of farmer exchange visits and study tours (Ethiopia and India) have been undertaken.</p>",,nav,,IWA,"<p>INDICATOR 1: Adoption by the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation, Egypt and the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources, Sudan of a framework for integrated and sustainable management of Lake Nasser/Nubia (LNN) Sub-basin.<br />Preliminary steps have been taken and significant progress made in achieving the target. A joint technical steering committee (JTSC) has been established and since its establishment in 2010 this Committee has met three (3) already. Participation at these meetings has been satisfactory and recommendations from these meetings have been fully incorporated into the annual work plans.  The Nile Research Institute (NRI) that is a key partner in the implementation of the Project has completed analyzes of biophysical field survey data for 2009 and 2010 that has been obtained from both the Sudanese and Egyptian sides of the Lake. Data from the March 2011 survey mission is also available.  Under a consultant hire the Project has produced a sediment study report of the LNN. Under the oversight of the Eastern Nile <br />Technical Regional Organization (ENTRO) the Project has completed the first phase of the sediment and water quality monitoring framework.  Consultants have been hired to undertake the socioeconomic surveys for both Egypt and Sudan portions of LNN. An open source database management system has been developed, tested and installed under a turn-key consultancy involving a local firm in Egypt that has provided a one-year warranty during which period system modifications and improvements will be carried at no additional financial burden to the Sub-component. Two training sessions have been provided so far. These include the fundamentals of survey training that was carried out from January 9-19, 2011. Participants were from Sudan (4#), High Aswam Dam Authority HADA (1#), NRI (#1) and Nile Water <br />Sector NWS (2#). From March 26 to April 4, 2011 hydrographic survey training was delivered to 23 participants including seven (7#) from HADA, one (10 from NRI, two (2#) from NWS and four (4#) from Sudan.<br />It should be noted that these studies are prerequisite for the preparation of the framework for integrated management of the LNN and its adoption by the two riparian countries.</p>",nav,,nav,,nav,,nav,,nap,,nav,,nav,,0,,0,,nav,,
